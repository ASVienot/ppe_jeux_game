Serious Games for Opening Up Scientific Discovery

   How can serious games be used to contribute to the Year of Open
   Science?
   Serious Games Initiative
   Serious Games Initiative
   Science and Technology Innovation Program
--
   have been turning to unique technology to facilitate that type of
   engagement: games. As a medium, digital games have wide use; the
   Entertainment Software Association estimates that in 2022, over 215
   million people in the United States played video games regularly.
   Research institutions have used games to not only reach new audiences
   but also speed up scientific research and make scientific discoveries,
--
   experts look to a Year of Open Science, learning from these
   examples—and looking to the future potentials of games supporting
   research—can help level up efforts.

Educational Games for Leading Research Questions

   To understand how an agency can use games, let’s look at two ways of
   implementing games. First, institutions can develop a new game that is
   framed around a particular research question. Games can visualize data
   outside the lab, affording not only educational opportunities but
--
   virtual conference called DataViz+Cancer that highlights some key
   considerations in using games–and other types of visualizations–in
   research. Two prominent examples illustrate this approach: Foldit and
   Eyewire. Both projects rely on crowd-sourcing data through a game to
   help accelerate research.
--
   research by crowdsourcing the folding of proteins. The research
   Institutions involved include University of Washington Center for Game
   Science, University of Washington Institute for Protein Design,
--

   Foldit is a free-to-play puzzle game that challenges players to fold
   proteins. In doing so, players contribute to a dataset to help bring
   solutions to diseases like COVID-19, HIV, Alzheimers, and more. It is
   often the example by which game-based crowdsourcing projects measure
   themselves, in part due to its success: in less than three weeks in
--

   These games illustrate that for crowdsourcing, data needs to be not
   only fun for users to engage with, but also easily digestible and
   distributed. Importantly, the tasks are manageable. The games break
   down an overall research question into small, bite-sized problem sets
--

   But what makes it a game is the employment of play–and competition–that
   everyone from researchers to science educators appreciate. In both
--
   forms of visible competition go one step further in developing a sense
   of community around the game that is so vital to long-term
   participation.

Commercial Game Companies Collaborating with Research Institutions

   In addition to creating their own game, there is a growing interest in
   how researchers can also work with commercial game companies to engage
   existing audiences. An example of this is the collaboration around EVE
   Online. EVE Online is a massive multiplayer online roleplaying game
   that is perhaps best known for corporate espionage and heistsin a
--
   it boasts a unique user base of 25 million globally with approximately
   300,000-400,000 players concurrently. It is a commercial game that has
   opened its doors to crowdsourcing scientific research through themed
   content embedded in the game itself under a mini-game called “Project
   Discovery.”
--
   Project Discovery, the citizen science project, originally launched as
   a mini-game within the game in 2016. Partners for the latest project,
   focusing on support for COVID-19, included McGill University, BD,
   Beckman Coulter, FlowJo, BC Cancer, Massively Multiplayer Online
   Science, and CCP Games (the studio that makes EVE Online), and the
   project was supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and
--
   cataloging different cell structures in over 250,000 images. In a
   recent version of the mini-game, players mapped flow cytometry by
   creating polygons around cells to help scientists understand immune
--
   There are a few things that were attributed to this success. First,
   while an innovative mini-game, “Project Discovery” fits within the
   overall feel of the game, with mechanics similar to other in-game
   tasks. But this mini-game also hits home on a nuanced way of
   understanding player motivation: it isn’t just about in-game rewards.
   In the same report from IGN, EVE Online Creative Director, Bergur
   Finnbogason pointed out three primary player types: those playing for
   in-game rewards, those playing because they were already deeply
   invested in EVE Online, and those playing for science.
--
   While a qualitative observation, studies have time and again
   demonstrated that motivation for game players is varied. Those wishing
   to capitalize on games as a way to build out scientific research should
   consider multiple ways of incentivizing participation. While in-game
   rewards most certainly help, some players will be motivated because it
   affords them an opportunity to deepen their engagement with the game
   and its story; others because it allows them to explore something new,
--

   These examples highlight ways that games have fostered the acceleration
   of scientific research while also expanding the scope of contributors
   to that research. In the case of Foldit and Eyewire, researchers
   leveraged game elements to make science more engaging and build a
   community that has made real-world impacts. In the case of EVE Online,
   an already popular game title was used to crowdsource data for health
   research. In both cases the research teams distributed the data to not
   only make it more adaptable for broad use, but transform it into a
   playful experience through puzzles and game mechanics. The key is to
   recognize both the broad possibilities of games and the diverse
   motivations and objectives of their players. Just like with any other
   medium, people play video games for a variety of reasons that can be
   tapped into to increase scientific engagement. Some gamers value points
   and in-game rewards while others seek opportunities to explore new
   horizons in the game or deepen their play. Some prefer supporting a
   broader community, while others relish competition. What’s also

Understanding Games: How Video Games &amp Board Games Work

--

     It is a basic paradox of games that while the rules themselves are
     generally definite, unambiguous, and easy to use, the enjoyment of a
     game depends on these easy to use rules presenting challenges that
     cannot be easily overcome.
--

   Games are structured activities that are governed by a set of rules.
   The rules of a game define how the game is played, what actions are
   allowed or prohibited, and how players should behave. They provide a
   framework for the game and help to ensure that it is fair and enjoyable
   for all players.

   Rules are an integral part of games, and they serve a variety of
   purposes. One of the main purposes of rules is to establish a level
   playing field for all players. By defining the parameters of the game,
   rules help to ensure that everyone is playing by the same set of rules
   and that no one has an unfair advantage. Rules can also help to make
   games more predictable and strategic, as players can plan their moves
   based on a clear understanding of what is and is not allowed.
--
   Additionally, rules can help to create a sense of structure and order
   in games, which can make them more enjoyable and satisfying to play.
   Finally, rules can help to promote sportsmanship and good behavior in
   games, as they define how players should interact with each other and
   how they should behave.

   In one sense, rules in games are completely arbitrary, because they can
   be anything we make up. But in another sense, they are not arbitrary,
   in the sense that they are not chosen randomly or without purpose, and
   we must obey them in order to play the game properly. Rather, the rules
   of a game are typically carefully designed to create a specific type of
   gameplay experience and to achieve specific goals or objectives.

   For example, the rules of a board game might be designed to create a
   balance between strategy and luck, to make the game challenging but
   also fair for all players. The rules of a video game might be designed
   to create a sense of immersion and to make the game more realistic or
   believable.

   In some cases, the rules of a game may be modified or altered in order
   to achieve a specific goal or to make the game more enjoyable. However,
   even in these cases, the changes to the rules are generally not
--
   Creating a set of rules requires you to mentally switch back and forth
   between the game’s rule framework and the experience that will be
   provided to the followers, er, I mean players, of your rule set. When
   creating rules and games, you’ll frequently think in diagrammatic
   languages, whereas what the players experience is not your wireframes
--

   Constitutive Rules are what count as legal and fair in the game. Any
   attempt to circumvent these restrictions is dishonest.
--
   A Rule of Infraction, like an offsides call or a foul ball, are an
   integral aspect of the game. Strategic infractions include the
   intentional fouling of an opponent for tactical or time-buying purposes
   (like with personal fouls in basketball). Games, however, wouldn’t
   normally permit players to cheat or otherwise violate the laws of the
   game.

   The Rules of Skill are recommendations rather than mandates about how
   to play the game. For instance, it’s illogical to allow players to
   score against themselves (perform own-goals), but it is often possible
--

   A game mechanic is a specific rule or set of rules that defines how a
   game functions and how players interact with it. Game mechanics are an
   essential part of game design and can have a major impact on the
   gameplay experience.

   There are many different types of game mechanics, and they can vary
   widely depending on the type of game. Some common examples of game
   mechanics include:
--
   Resource management: This involves managing and using resources, such
   as money or resources in a game, in order to achieve a goal.

   Chance: This involves using elements of chance, such as dice rolls or
   shuffled decks of cards, to determine the outcome of events in a game.

--
   Role-playing: This involves assuming the role of a specific character
   or persona and acting out that role within the context of the game.

   Whereas computer game systems can readily hide their mechanisms which
   have to be uncovered through interaction, board games nearly always
   have their mechanics laid bare for the player in the rulebook.
   Everything that occurs between the first few turns and someone winning
   the game is categorizable as a game mechanic.

   The game’s mechanics can alter the game state, the options available to
   players, and even other game mechanics. The mechanics of a game can
   either be predetermined by the system or determined by the players
   themselves. If a mechanic leaves no room for player agency, then that
   mechanic is system-driven, which is more common in video games than in
   board games, since the latter tend to put the onus of all
   decision-making on the players themselves.

   The mechanics of video games are frequently easy to figure out by
   observation and experimentation; in many cases, you don’t even need to
   read the manual before getting started. This is where mobile games can
   be particularly engaging: the small screen gives the player only a
   limited amount of room to move their thumb and eyes over the screen.
   Rules aren’t always necessary in mobile games because players have so
   few options on how to interact with the game.

   We should probably define game mechanics more formally now:

     Game mechanics are methods invoked by agents for interacting with
     the game world. (“Defining Game Mechanics,” gamestudies.org)

   Actions in a game require mechanics, such as the ability to roll dice,
   leap, battle, push buttons, take turns, etc. Mechanics can also be
--
   aesthetics, we shouldn’t be surprised if real-world physics is often
   distorted in digital games, for aesthetic and experiential effect;
   animation in film has always relied on highly exaggerated movements
--
   phenomena but rather to express something more human and emotional, and
   this practice continues with video games.

The best card games to play with a standard deck

   [card-games.jpg]

   Card games have entertained people for centuries and have always been a
   great way to pass time. They're social, portable and inexpensive
   (unless you're gambling with money), and the rules are easy to learn.
   For me, card games were integral to my childhood: I grew up playing
   cards with my parents and three siblings. I was six years old when I
   played my first card in a game of Crazy Eights, and I've dealt
   countless hands since then.

   I'm passionate about a wide variety of games, whether they be board,
   tabletop or card games, and the ones listed here are what I've played
   most often and that bring back the best memories. If you decide to play

Card games for 2 people

   Most multiplayer card games can be scaled up or down to accommodate
   more or fewer players and the games mentioned here are no exception.
   There are variations for three people, but they're at their best when
--

   This is one of my favourite games because it doesn't take long to play;
   the rules are simple; and there's the dramatic possibility of starting
   out badly, but ultimately winning the game, and vice versa. It belongs
   to the rummy family of card games, which involve grouping cards
   together in certain sequences and sets. The objective is to be the
--

   The game is played in rounds, which end when one player has no cards
   left in their hand. The catch is if you still have cards in your hand
--
   a board to keep score. I love the board because it's such an iconic
   part of the game, but you don't have to have one to play. There have
   been times when I haven't had a board nearby, and I've kept score with
--
   same value, runs, and card combinations that add up to 15. The running
   total can't exceed 31 during play. It's a quirky game with three phases
   in which you can score points, but it's not nearly as complicated as it

   Cribbage is the perfect balance of strategy and luck. With the discard
   rule at the start of the game, you have to determine your strategy
   before you know whether you'll be able to execute it. There is also a

   These beloved classics are often played long into the night and are
   staples of veteran card tables. These games have endured particularly
   well because they're among the most social of card games and have
   become a part of pop culture through films, television and gaming.
--
   Popular in parts of Canada — especially Ontario — euchre is a
   trick-taking game for four people on two teams (though there are
   variations for between two and eight players). For a card game that
   forbids table talk, it's a surprisingly social game. The better you
   know your partner, the better your chances of winning. Trust in your
--
   and persuading other players to fold. Depending on whether you're
   playing at home or in a casino, the game can be as serious or as casual
   as you like.
--

   Like euchre, hearts is a trick-taking game. However, the objective is
   to take the fewest number of tricks and avoid scoring points. For this
   reason, it is known as a game of evasion. Three or more players may
   gather round a table for hearts, but it's most often played with four
--
   a low-ranking spade after the first trick to draw the queen out. The
   game ends when one player scores 100 points or more. All players tally
   up their points, and the person with the fewest wins.

The best games to play as a family

   Card games are a great way to support your kids' arithmetic and
   strategy skills — but fun comes first. Many are suitable for children,

   through the gaming site Neopets.com, but I have played my fair share of
   offline Cheat too. It's a highly satisfying game because there's
   nothing like knowing another player is cheating because you have the

   This is a game that my family used to close out card game night because
   it inherently reorders the deck and leaves it ready to be shuffled
   again for the next game night. It's straightforward: the objective is
   to get rid of all the cards in your hand by playing them in sequence.
--

   This game is fast-paced and requires quick mental addition. Certain
   cards have designated values and actions, which can be written down on
--
   save yourself when needed. It's best to save your smaller value cards
   and special cards until the end stages of the game so you have them
   when you need them.

   Children will enjoy the speed of the game and creating strategies to
   stay afloat when the value of the pile is high.
--

   All of the above games have a special place in my heart, but here are a
   couple you might not have heard of. I have fond memories of playing

   Rummoli, aka Tripoli, is a Canadian game that is part board game and
   part poker. It's a delight and my favourite game for a large group of
   people. It's light on strategy and heavy on fun.

   with as few as two and as many as eight. The more players there are,
   the faster the game goes.

--
   players can place their chips. These areas correspond to different
   cards or sequences in the second phase of the game. Each player puts a
   chip on each space on the board. There's also a pot which goes to the

   After the poker game, people play their cards in sequence. The twist is
   there's a "ghost" hand dealt, and cards from this hand cannot be

   I learned this game while I was on holiday in 2018. It's designed for
   two players, but can be played with more. (I learned a four-player
   version.) If you like to meddle with your opponents' strategy as much
   as trying to win for yourself, this is the game for you.

   The objective of the game is get rid of all the cards in your "payoff
   pile" by playing them on stacks in the centre of the table. The card on

   their only possible move. Spite and Malice is one of the more strategic
   games listed here. It's a lot of fun; just be sure not to ruin any
   friendships while you're on your quest to win.

   Now, what games to play? While many are familiar with a few standard
   card games, there's a vast world of card games yet to be explored. Over
   the years, despite my extensive collection of modern games, I've found
   myself drawn to traditional card games, especially when I have a custom
   deck at hand.

   Here's a compilation of my top traditional card games, sorted
   alphabetically, and categorized for adults or children. At the end,
   I've listed books and resources on card games that I personally
   recommend. Each game's description includes its ideal player count.
   Notably, many of these games are perfect for just two participants.

   This list primarily focuses on traditional card games that have stood
   the test of time. While some recent games are mentioned, the primary
   goal is to highlight games that use a standard deck, rather than modern
   adaptations. Of course, there are countless other games playable with a
   standard deck; this list represents the most well-known and those I've
--
   I hope this inspires you to explore beyond the usual and dive into some
   classic card games. Trust me, the journey is rewarding with many
   fantastic games awaiting discovery. For easy access to game rules, each
   game listed is linked to Pagat.com, an authoritative source for card
   game guidelines.

Social and Family Games

   This category is somewhat arbitrary in that some of the card games in
   the other categories can also be enjoyed socially or with children, and
   the games in this category are certainly not just for children. But if
   I was looking for a fun and lighter game that is easy to learn and
   play, these are all excellent choices.
   Blitz (2-12 players) - A popular and casual/social card game, also
   known as "Scat", "Thirty-One", "Ride the Bus", and "Blitz". By drawing
--
   Cheat (3-13 players) - Also called "I Doubt It" or "Bullsh**", this is
   a game many children have played. The aim is to be the first to get rid
   of all your cards, and you can bluff about what cards you are playing
--
   the entire pile.
   Egyptian Ratscrew (2-6 players) - This is a quick-slapping game that is
   like Slap Jack on steroids, and has been published commercially under
--

   Golf (2-6 players) - A great casual game for two players that also
   works with 3 or more. There are many variations, the most common one
--

   GOPS (2 players) - A simple and quick bidding/bluffing game for two
   players. The Diamonds are point cards corresponding to their value, and
--
   the revealed point card going to the higher played card. GOPS is an
   acronym for "Game Of Pure Strategy", since there is zero luck.
   Knock Out Whist (2-7 players) - Also called "Trumps", this is a
--
   after each hand by winning at least one trick. The first hand has seven
   tricks, and it becomes harder to stay in the game because each
   successive hand has one less trick. A perfect game to introduce people
   to trick-taking.
   Mao (2-7 players) - This game has especially been popular in college
   and university crowds since the 1960s, and the aim is not just to win
--
   additions, but the rules may not be discussed; new players are expected
   to try to figure out the rules by observing a game and by trial and
   error. Theoretically there are overtones of Mornington Crescent,
   Fizzbin, and Calvinball, but Mao is actually a playable game.
   Palace (2-6 players) - Also called "Sh**head", "Karma" or "Idiot". A
   very light casual game, where the aim is to avoid being last to get rid
   of your cards. Players each have a row of three face down cards, a row
--
   "A**hole", and fun for groups, this is an easy introduction to the
   family of climbing games. The aim is to get rid of cards as soon as
   possible, and you must play at least as many cards as the previous
--
   was published commercially as The Great Dalmuti. For more advanced
   climbing games, see Big Two later on this list.
   Ranter-Go-Round (3-12 players) - This is also known as "Screw Your
   Neighbor",  "Chase The Ace" or "Cuckoo", with slight variations. A
   simple game of passing cards around, with a high luck element, the
   player with the lowest card at the end loses a chip, and the aim is to
   avoid being eliminated by losing your chips.
   Rummy (2-6 players) - A classic card game, in which players draw and
   discard cards, trying to get "melds" that typically consist of sets of
   the same values or runs of consecutive values. Many variants exist,
   including Gin Rummy, which is an excellent game and appears later on
   this list, as well as some commercially published games like
   the Mystery Rummy series. Contract Rummy (3-5 players) also developed
--
   Rummy was published commercially under the name Phase Ten.
   Scopa (2-6 players) - A fascinating classic Italian card game that is
   especially good for two players, and for four players as a partnership
   game called Scopone. Players are using cards in their hand to "capture"
   point-scoring cards from a common pool, with captured cards matching or
--
   appears later on this list.
   Speed (2-4 players) - Also called "Spit", this a high speed game
   similar in style to Nertz (see later on this list), but slightly easier
--
   or lower value to a common stock.
   Spoons (2-8 players) - A hilarious game for kids or large groups, also
   known as "Pig" or "Donkey". Players have four cards and simultaneously

Trick-Taking Games

   Trick taking games are one of the most common types of card games, and
   classics like Hearts and Spades are good examples. It is a game where
   players all have a hand of cards, and game-play revolves around a
   series of "tricks", in which each trick involves everyone playing one
   card from their hand, with the trick typically going to the person who
   played the highest card. If you have never played a trick-taking game
   before, I suggest you start with Knock Out Whist, which was listed in
   the previous category, and is an excellent and fun way to get
   introduced to this style of game.
   500 (4 players) - The national card game of Australia. A skilful
   trick-taking game where players bid for the number of tricks they think
   their partnership can win. The winning bidder is allowed to exchange
--
   has some similarities to the two player version of the American
   game Pinochle.
   Bridge (4 players) - The ultimate classic among trick-taking card
   games. It is played in partnerships, and gives much room for much
   skilful play. Contract Bridge is often played in organized club
   settings, and the bidding and game-play has an extensive series of
   conventions that can take some time to learn in order to play well.
   Briscola (2-6 players) - An Italian trick-taking game that is quite
   easy to learn and play especially as a two player game. Using just 40
   cards, the aim is play tricks from your hand of three in order to win
--
   player Briscola Chiamata variant.
   Euchre (4 players) - Extremely popular as a social game in parts of
   Canada and the USA, Euchre can especially be fun when played in a
--
   from a five card hand, with trump determined by a turned up
   card. Ecarte (2 players) is an excellent trick-taking game that is very
   similar to Euchre, but better suited for a two player game.
   German Whist (2 players) - An excellent Whist style game for two
   players. Each player has a hand of 13 cards, and the first phase
--
   the player winning the most tricks is the winner.
   Hearts (3-7 players) - One of the all time classic trick-taking games,
   where the aim is to avoid taking tricks with Hearts, since these are
--
   There is no trump suit.
   Jass (2-4 players) - The national Swiss game, playable with two players
   or in partnerships. This is part of the Jass family which originated in
--
   Le Truc (2 players) - This out-of-the-ordinary
   betting/bluffing/trick-taking game is a 19th century French game using
   a 32 card deck, and was especially popularized after inclusion in Sid
   Sackson's Gamut of Games. A brilliant bluffing game where you use a
   hand of three cards to play only three tricks, but can increase the
   value of a hand throughout the game, to bluff and cause your opponent
   to fold. Be aware of some rule variations. Both the French Le Truc and
   the Spanish Truc (which has 2 player partnerships) are derived from the
   older English game Put (2 players), which is a simpler two player
   bluffing game that I can also recommend.
   Ninety-Nine (3 players) - This original game by David Parlett is
   regarded as one of the very best trick-taking games for exactly 3
   players. Only 36 cards are used, and from a hand of 12 players lay
--
   Down the River, Bust, Estimation, and some less savoury titles that are
   variations on Oh ****. A great trick taking game where you bid how many
   tricks you can win, while the hand size increases or decreases each
   round. The game enables considerable skill, because even with bad cards
   you score if you bid correctly. Numerous scoring variants exist, one
   being published commercially under the name Wizard.
   Pinochle (4 players) - A popular and classic American trick-taking game
   for partnerships that uses an 80 card deck. Gameplay starts with an
--
   exists.
   Piquet (2 players) - This classic game has a very long history going
   back several centuries. It is demanding since it has some old-fashioned
   complications, but is still popular, and regarded as one of the
   all-time best and most skilful card games for just two players.
   Pitch (4 players) - Derived from the old English game All Fours, this
   game has especially been popular in parts of the USA, and there are
   many variations. Typically played in partnerships, it begins with a
--
   highest total point value.
   Rook (4 players) - Rook is a terrific partnership trick taking game
   with bidding that was even published commercially under that name with
--
   Schnapsen (2 players) - Popular in many parts of Europe, Schnapsen is
   the national card game of Austria, and is a classic trick-taking card
   game for two players with a long history, and allows for genuinely
   skilful and clever play. Played with a small deck, one of its
--
   see here and here.
   Skat (3 players) - This classic trick-taking game is the national card
   game of Germany. It features complex scoring and bidding, but is one of
   the best card games for three players. A similar game with simpler
   bidding and scoring rules is Schafkopf, which was been Americanized and
--
   demanding Doppelkopf (i.e. Double Sheepshead).
   Spades (4 players) - One of the better trick taking games for
   partnerships, and another classic after being invented and popularized
--
   bidding and scoring is not the easiest if you are new to trick-taking
   games, it is a game that allows for more skill than casual games like
   euchre.
   Whist (4 players) - A simple but classic trick-taking card game from
   which many others are derived. Played in partnerships, there is no

Non Trick-Taking Games

   Trick taking games are arguably one of the most popular and common
   types of card games, which is why they were listed as a separate
   category. But there are certainly a large number of other fantastic
   card games as well. Most of the games listed in the "Social and Family
   Games" category were also non tricking-taking games, but the games
   listed below tend to be a little more thoughtful and involved.
--
   this list) represents one of the more accessible and well-known
   climbing games. With the climbing genre, the idea is to be the first
   player to get rid of all your cards, playing cards individually or in
   special combinations. For a slightly easier climbing game than Big Two,
   consider Tien Len, which is the national card game of Vietnam. One of
   the most popular climbing games of all times is Tichu, which was
   published commercially with a special deck.
   Canasta (4 players) - A game that became extremely popular in the
   1950s, Canasta uses two standard decks, and is best in two-player
   partnerships. It is a rummy style of game in which the aim is to make
   melds of seven cards of the same value, and "go out" by playing your
--
   and Foot.
   Casino (2-4 players) - This classic card game is a "fishing" game that
   has some parallels to the simpler Scopa (see earlier on this list), and
--
   enjoy finding the point scoring combinations, while the
   imbalance/asymmetry of each game turn makes it especially interesting.
   Eleusis (4-8 players) - A modern card game simulating scientific
   research, as players ("scientists") conduct experiments to determine
--
   Gin Rummy (2 players) - Derived from Rummy (see earlier on this list),
   Gin Rummy is a "knocking game" that differs from Rummy in that melds
   are kept in hand until the end of a deal. It is an excellent and
   time-tested two player game.
   Nertz (2-6 players) - Also known as "Racing Demon" or "Pounce", Nertz
--
   The aim is to be the first to get rid of cards from your Nertz piles by
   building upwards on common foundations. It is basically the same game
   as the commercially available Ligretto/Dutch Blitz, but played with a
   standard deck.
   Poker (2-10 players) - This is considered the ultimate bluffing game,
   and No Limit Texas Hold 'Em has been popularized with the help of
--
   played for money, suggesting that the thrill is in the gambling rather
   than the game-play. Even if you do not play for money, you do have to
   approach the game semi-seriously for it to be fun, otherwise it is too
   easy for someone to play foolishly and hand another player the game. A
   must for those who enjoy bluffing.
   Spite &amp Malice (2-5 players) - Also known as "Cat &amp Mouse", this is a
   competitive patience/solitaire game for two or more players that uses
   two decks, and is better known to most people under its commercially
--
   overall concept is somewhat similar.
   Zetema (2 players) - This is an obscure Victorian card game that
   revived in popularity as a result of Sid Sackson's A Gamut of Games.
   David Parlett recommends it as an out-of-the-ordinary card game that is
   "long and savory". It is played with a 65-card deck (52 cards plus an
--
   So where should you start? Hopefully some of the descriptions I have
   provided will intrigue you enough to give a particular game a shot, or
   look into it further. But often games will depend on who you are
   playing with, the number of players you have, and the kind of game you
   are looking for. So to help you branch out beyond the repertoire that
   you might already be familiar with, here are some recommendations for
   games that I especially suggest for different situations.
   Are you looking for...
   - a game for just two players? GOPS and Scopa are two simpler games
   that are quite rewarding. If you want a trick-taking game for just two,
   then Briscola and German Whist are both straight forward and good
--
   every bit as good today as they have always been.
   - a game for four-players in partnerships? There are several good
   trick-taking games to choose from in this category, and while the

   scoring system, Scopa is definitely a rewarding game that older

   two, and so does Golf.

Solitaire Games

   But what about if you have nobody to play with? The good news is that
   there is a wide range of excellent solitaire card games, a category
   sometimes referred to with the catch-all "Patience". Patience or
   Solitaire games are especially popular due to the fact that many of
   them come pre-installed on personal computer operating systems. Some
   solitaire games come down to pure luck, but there are many excellent
   ones that require genuine skill, and can be a very rewarding challenge
   to play.
   Rules: Fortunately you can learn many solitaire games with the help of
   free apps, or the many websites that offer these games to play for
   free. You will find lots of resources online that will teach you rules
   for different games, and a good place to begin is the Wikipedia page
   which lists solitaire games. Also check Polymorphic Solitaire, Pretty
   Good Solitaire, and Solitaire Network, which all have extensive lists
   of solitaire games, rules for each, and free online play.
   Recommendations: There are different types of solitaire games, and here
   are some of the better and more popular ones I can recommend, grouped
--
   Other types: Aces Up, Calculation
   Thematic: I also highly recommend Bowling Solitaire by genius game
   designer Sid Sackson. It is entirely unlike all the other solitaire
   games mentioned, but is an incredibly thematic and clever game.
   Apps: There are some fantastic apps available for free which have a
   wide range of solitaire games. Of the ones I have tried, I can
   especially recommend Full Deck Solitaire (by GRL Games), Solebon
   Solitaire (by Solebon LLC), and Solitaire City (by Digital Smoke LLC).

   This article should get you well on your way to playing some fun card
   games. But if you are interested in exploring the world of card games
   further, there is certainly a lot more you can do. So here are some
   ideas for further expanding your horizons, learning more about the
   great card games that are out there, and even options for playing them
   when you have nobody else around to play with.
   Get a book: There are some fantastic books with rules to all the
   classic card games. You will need some way to learn how to play a new
   game, and resolve those inevitable rules arguments that might arise.
   Having a reliable book is something you can take with you when you are
   on the go. Here are two of the best:
   ● The Penguin Book of Card Games - Also published under the title The
   Penguin Encyclopedia of Card Games, this book by David Parlett is
   easily the most comprehensive book in the English language with
   standard card games. If you are looking to discover new games, or find
   rules to lots of different games, this is the best book to get.
   ● Hoyle's Rules of Games - An authoritative and standard text on
   classic card games. I personally own the Third Revised edition (Philip
   D. Morehead), and have used it often, although it is not as exhaustive
   as David Parlett's book, so it can happen that the card game of your
   choice is not included. But the section on card games is very useful,
   especially the contents pages which categorizes the games by
   suitability for adults/children and by number of players; plus it has
   rules to other classic games as well. This book and a deck of playing
   cards is all you need to take along on a vacation!
   Check online resources: There are some terrific resources online about
   traditional card games. Pagat.com is easily the most authoritative and
   best when it comes to rules, but there are certainly other places that
--
   ● Pagat.com - John McLeod's award-winning site is considered to be the
   most exhaustive website with rules for different card games played with
   a standard deck. An outstanding and useful resource.
   ● BicycleCards.com - Bicycle's official website has their official
   rules for many different card games. It also has a helpful search
   function that allows you to find a suitable card game based on the
   number of players, who is playing, and type of game.
   ● BoardGameGeek.com - BoardGameGeek.com is the world's largest
   community of boardgamers. This page lists a number of games that can be
   played with a standard deck of playing cards, and gives some other
   links to their site. Also check their family page for traditional card
   games for more.
   ● Poker Suite - Cheapass Games offers a free download of the rules PDF
   for their Poker Suite, which is a collection of 14 original games that
   is well worth looking at.
   ● Femtitvå - Scott Huntington's free collection of 10 clever card games
   is inspired by modern games like Ticket to Ride and 7 Wonders.
   ● Isaludo - A set of ten modern card games designed to be played
   solitaire, created by hobbyist gamer Wilhelm Su from the Philippines.
   Play using an app: If you are not quite sure on the rules of how to
   play a specific card game mentioned above, there are plenty of apps
   available that will help you with that. The ideal way to learn a game
   is to have someone teach you, but an app is a fantastic second best,
   because it will enforce the rules. Many of them also include tutorials.
   There are quite a few software programs for card games that are readily
   available as well - most versions of Windows will come with Hearts and
   Spades, and some solitaire games too. Here are some good free apps for
   iOS for some of the games listed above; I've personally used, enjoyed,
   and can recommend all of these: Cribbage Craze (Cribbage) by Tim
   Eakins, Thirty One Rummy (Blitz) by North Sky Games, Briscola
   Pro (Briscola) by Appsmob, Scopa Dal Negro (Scopa) by Digitalmoka
--
   free app called Bicycle How To Play by United States Playing Card
   Company. You cannot play any games with this app, but it comes with
   rules for many of the most popular card games, so it functions as a
   digital document you can use on the fly to find the rules you need.
   Play online: Playing with an app that incorporates multiplayer games is
   one way to play online, but there are also websites dedicated to this
--
   here are a few that you can start
   with: cardgames.io, worldofcardgames.com, trickstercards.com,
   and cardzmania.com.
   Ask family and friends: Many families have their household favourites.
   Perhaps some of your friends know some great card games that they would
   just love to teach you! A night playing card games with family or
   friends makes for a relaxing social evening, and is a great way to
   spend time together.

Card game

--
   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Game using playing cards as the primary device
   For other uses, see Card game (disambiguation).

--

   A card game is any game using playing cards as the primary device with
   which the game is played, be they traditional or game-specific.
   Countless card games exist, including families of related games (such
   as poker). A small number of card games played with traditional decks
   have formally standardized rules with international tournaments being
   held, but most are folk games whose rules may vary by region, culture,
   location or from circle to circle.

   Traditional card games are played with a deck or pack of playing cards
   which are identical in size and shape. Each card has two sides, the
--
   In some cases several decks are shuffled together to form a single pack
   or shoe. Modern card games usually have bespoke decks, often with a
   vast amount of cards, and can include number or action cards. This type
   of game is generally regarded as part of the board game hobby.

   Games using playing cards exploit the fact that cards are individually
   identifiable from one side only, so that each player knows only the
   cards they hold and not those held by anyone else. For this reason card
   games are often characterized as games of chance or "imperfect
   information"—as distinct from games of strategy or perfect information,
   where the current position is fully visible to all players throughout
   the game.^[1] Many games that are not generally placed in the family of
   card games do in fact use cards for some aspect of their play.

   Some games that are placed in the card game genre involve a board. The
   distinction is that the play in a card game chiefly depends on the use
   of the cards by players (the board is a guide for scorekeeping or for
   card placement), while board games (the principal non-card game genre
   to use cards) generally focus on the players' positions on the board,

   Despite the presence of playing cards in Europe being recorded from
   around 1370, it is not until 1408 that the first card game is described
   in a document about the exploits of two card sharps; although it is
   evidently very simple, the game is not named. In fact the earliest
   games to be mentioned by name are Gleek, Ronfa and Condemnade, the
   latter being the game played by the aforementioned card cheats. All
   three are recorded during the 15th century,^[2] along with Karnöffel,
--

   Since the arrival trick-taking games in Europe in the late 14th
   century, there have only been two major innovations. The first was the
--
   example of such cards was ordered by the Duke of Milan around 1420 and
   included 16 trumps with images of Greek and Roman gods.^[5] Thus games
   played with Tarot cards appeared very early on and spread to most parts
--
   Peninsula, and the Balkans.^[6] However, we do not know the rules of
   the early Tarot games; the earliest detailed description in any
   language being those published by the Abbé de Marolles in Nevers in
--
   The concept of trumps was sufficiently powerful that it was soon
   transferred to games played with far cheaper ordinary packs of cards,
   as opposed to expensive Tarot cards. The first of these was Triomphe,
--
   Spaniard who left his native country for Milan in 1509 never to return;
   thus the game may date to the late 15th century.^[9]^[10]^[11]

   Others games that may well date to the 15th century are Pochen – the
   game of Bocken or Boeckels being attested in Strasbourg in 1441^[12] –
   and Thirty-One, which is first mentioned in a French translation of a
   1440 sermon by the Italian, Saint Bernadine, the name actually
   referring to two different card games: one like Pontoon and one like
   Commerce.^[13]
--
   In the 16th century printed documents replace handwritten sources and
   card games become a popular topic with preachers, autobiographists and
   writers in general. A key source of the games in vogue in France and
   Europe at that time is François Rabelais, whose fictional character
   Gargantua played no less than 30 card games, many of which are
   recognisable. They include: Aluette, Bête, Cent, Coquimbert, Coucou,
--
   Cardano also provides invaluable information including the earliest
   rules of Trappola. Among the most popular were the games of Flusso and
   Primiera, which originated in Italy and spread throughout Europe,
--

   In Britain the earliest known European fishing game was recorded in
   1522.^[15] Another first was Losing Loadum, noted by Florio in 1591,
   which is the earliest known English point-trick game.^[16] In Scotland,
   the game of Mawe, testified in the 1550s, evolved from a country game
   into one played at the royal Scottish court, becoming a favourite of
   James VI.^[17] The ancestor of Cribbage – a game called Noddy – is
   mentioned for the first time in 1589, "Noddy" being the Knave turned
--

   The 17th century saw an upsurge in the number of new games being
   reported as well as the first sets of rules, those for Piquet appearing
   in 1632 and Reversis in 1634.^[8] The first French games compendium, La
   Maison Académique, appeared in 1654 and it was followed in 1674 by
   Charles Cotton's The Compleat Gamester, although an earlier manuscript
   of games by Francis Willughby was written sometime between 1665 and
   1670.^[19] Cotton records the first rules for the classic English games
   of Cribbage, a descendant of Noddy, and Whist, a development of English

   Piquet was a two-player, trick-taking game that originated in France,
   probably in the 16th century and was initially played with 36 cards
   before, around 1690, the pack reduced to the 32 cards that gives the
   Piquet pack its name. Reversis is a reverse game in which players avoid
   taking tricks and appears to be an Italian invention that came to

   In the mid-17th century, a certain game named after Cardinal Mazarin,
   prime minister to King Louis XIV, became very popular at the French
   royal court. Called Hoc Mazarin, it had three phases, the final one of
   which evolved into a much simpler game called Manille that was renamed
   Comète on the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1682.^[21] In Comète the

   advantage of being able to start a new sequence. This concept spread to
   other 17th and 18th century games including Poque, Comete, Emprunt,
   Manille, Nain Jaune and Lindor,^[22]^[23] all except Emprunt being
--
   It was the 17th century that saw the second of the two great
   innovations being introduced into trick-taking games: the concept of
   bidding.^[3] This first emerged in the Spanish game of Ombre, an
   evolution of Triomphe that "in its time, was the most successful card
   game ever invented."^[24] Ombre's origins are unclear and obfuscated by
   the existence of a game called Homme or Bête in France, ombre and homme
   being respectively Spanish and French for 'man'. In Ombre, the player
   who won the bidding became the "Man" and played alone against the other
   two. The game spread rapidly across Europe, spawning variants for
   different numbers of players and known as Quadrille, Quintille,
--

   The first rules of any game in the German language were those for
   Rümpffen published in 1608 and later expanded in several subsequent
   editions. In addition, the first German games compendium, Palamedes
   Redivivus appeared in 1678, containing the rules for Hoick (Hoc),
--

   The evolution of card games continued apace, with notable national
   games emerging like Briscola and Tressette (Italy), Schafkopf
   (Bavaria), Jass (Switzerland), Mariage, the ancestor of Austria's
   Schnapsen and Germany's Sixty-Six, and Tapp Tarock, the progenitor of
   most modern central European Tarot games. Whist spread to the continent
   becoming very popular in the north and west. In France, Comet appeared,
   a game that later evolved into Nain Jaune and the Victorian game of
   Pope Joan.

Trick-taking games[edit]

   See also: List of trick-taking games

   There are two main types of trick-taking game which have different
   objectives. Both are based on the play of multiple tricks, in each of
--
   values of played cards one player wins or "takes" the trick.
     * Plain-trick games. Many common Anglo-American games fall into this
       category. The usual objective is to take the most tricks, but
--
       Whist and Spades are popular examples. Hearts, Black Lady and Black
       Maria are examples of reverse games in which the aim is to avoid
       certain cards.

     * Point-trick games. These are all European or of European origin.
       Individual cards have specific point values and the objective is
--
       especially those with higher value cards. The main group is the
       Ace-Ten family which includes many national games such as German
       Skat, French Belote, Dutch Klaberjass, Austrian Schnapsen, Spanish
--
       Mariáš. Pinochle is an American example of French or Swiss origin.
       All Tarot card games are of the point-trick variety including
       German Cego, Austrian Tarock, French Tarot and Italian Minchiate.

Matching games[edit]

   Main article: Matching game

   The object of a matching (or sometimes "melding") game is to acquire
   particular groups of matching cards before an opponent can do so. In
   Rummy, this is done through drawing and discarding, and the groups are
   called melds. Mahjong is a very similar game played with tiles instead
   of cards. Non-Rummy examples of match-type games generally fall into
   the "fishing" genre and include the children's games Go Fish and Old
   Maid.

Shedding games[edit]

   See also: Category:Shedding-type card games and List of shedding-type
   games

   In a shedding game, players start with a hand of cards, and the object
   of the game is to be the first player to discard all cards from one's
   hand. Common shedding games include Crazy Eights (commercialized by
   Mattel as Uno) and Daihinmin. Some matching-type games are also
   shedding-type games; some variants of Rummy such as Paskahousu, Phase
   10, Rummikub, the bluffing game I Doubt It, and the children's games
   Musta Maija and Old Maid, fall into both categories.

Catch and collect games[edit]

   See also: Category:Catch and collect games

   The object of an accumulating game is to acquire all cards in the deck.
   Examples include most War type games, and games involving slapping a
   discard pile such as Slapjack. Egyptian Ratscrew has both of these

Fishing games[edit]

   "Fishing game" redirects here. For the video game genre, see fishing
   video game.

   See also: Category:Fishing card games

   In fishing games, cards from the hand are played against cards in a
   layout on the table, capturing table cards if they match.^[25] Fishing
   games are popular in many nations, including China, where there are
   many diverse fishing games. Scopa is considered one of the national
   card games of Italy. Cassino is the only fishing game to be widely
   played in English-speaking countries. Zwicker has been described as a
   "simpler and jollier version of Cassino", played in Germany.^[26]
   Tablanet (tablić) is a fishing-style game popular in Balkans.

  Comparing games[edit]

   See also: Category:Comparing card games

   Comparing card games are those where hand values are compared to
   determine the winner, also known as "vying" or "showdown" games. Poker,
   blackjack, mus, and baccarat are examples of comparing card games. As
   seen, nearly all of these games are designed as gambling games.

  Patience and solitaire games[edit]

   Solitaire games are designed to be played by one player. Most games
   begin with a specific layout of cards, called a tableau, and the object

  Drinking card games[edit]

   See also: Category:Drinking card games

   Drinking card games are drinking games using cards, in which the object
   in playing the game is either to drink or to force others to drink.
   Many games are ordinary card games with the establishment of "drinking
   rules"; President, for instance, is virtually identical to Daihinmin
   but with additional rules governing drinking. Poker can also be played
   using a number of drinks as the wager. Another game often played as a
   drinking game is Toepen, quite popular in the Netherlands. Some card
   games are designed specifically to be played as drinking games.

  Compendium games[edit]

   Compendium games consist of a sequence of different contracts played in
   succession. A common pattern is for a number of reverse deals to be
   played, in which the aim is to avoid certain cards, followed by a final
   contract which is a domino-type game. Examples include: Barbu, Herzeln,
   Lorum and Rosbiratschka. In other games, such as Quodlibet and Rumpel,
   there is a range of widely varying contracts.

  Collectible card games (CCGs)[edit]

   See also: Collectible card game, List of collectible card games, and
   Category:Collectible card games

   Collectible card games (CCG) are proprietary playing card games. CCGs
   are games of strategy between two or more players. Each player has
   their own deck constructed from a very large pool of unique cards in
--
   art. New card sets are released periodically and sold as starter decks
   or booster packs. Obtaining the different cards makes the game a
   collectible card game, and cards are sold or traded on the secondary
   market. Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon, and Yu-Gi-Oh! are well-known
   collectible card games.

  Living card games (LCGs)[edit]

   See also: Living card game and Fantasy Flight Games

   Living card games (LCGs) are similar to collectible card games (CCGs),
   with their most distinguishing feature being a fixed distribution
   method, which breaks away from the traditional collectible card game
   format. While new cards for CCGs are usually sold in the form of
--
   LCGs thrive on a model that requires players to acquire one core set in
   order to play the game, which players can further customize by
   acquiring extra sets or expansions featuring new content in the form of

   These games revolve around wagers of money. Though virtually any game
   in which there are winning and losing outcomes can be wagered on, these

   part of the game. Some of these games involve players betting against
   each other, such as poker, while in others, like blackjack, players

    Poker games[edit]

   called the pot, the value of which changes as the game progresses that

   including its age and its popularity among Western militaries, it is
   one of the most universally known card games in existence.

  Other card games[edit]

   See also: Category:Dedicated deck card games

   Many other card games have been designed and published on a commercial
   or amateur basis. In some cases, the game uses the standard 52-card
   deck, but the object is unique. In Eleusis, for example, players play
--

   Most of these games however typically use a specially made deck of
   cards designed specifically for the game (or variations of it). The
   decks are thus usually proprietary, but may be created by the game's
   players. Uno, Phase 10, Set, and 1000 Blank White Cards are popular
   dedicated-deck card games; 1000 Blank White Cards is unique in that the
   cards for the game are designed by the players of the game while
   playing it; there is no commercially available deck advertised as such.

  Fictional card games[edit]

   See also: List of fictional games § Card games

   Many games, including card games, are fabricated by science fiction
   authors and screenwriters to distance a culture depicted in the story

   depict background activities in an atmosphere like a bar or rec room,
   but sometimes the drama revolves around the play of the game. Some of
   these games become real card games as the holder of the intellectual
   property develops and markets a suitable deck and ruleset for the game,
   while others lack sufficient descriptions of rules, or depend on cards

Typical structure of card games[edit]

--

   Any specific card game imposes restrictions on the number of players.
   The most significant dividing lines run between one-player games and
   two-player games, and between two-player games and multi-player games.
   Card games for one player are known as solitaire or patience card
   games. (See list of solitaire card games.) Generally speaking, they are
   in many ways special and atypical, although some of them have given
   rise to two- or multi-player games such as Spite and Malice.

   In card games for two players, usually not all cards are distributed to
   the players, as they would otherwise have perfect information about the
   game state. Two-player games have always been immensely popular and
   include some of the most significant card games such as piquet,
   bezique, sixty-six, klaberjass, gin rummy and cribbage. Many
   multi-player games started as two-player games that were adapted to a
   greater number of players. For such adaptations a number of non-obvious
   choices must be made beginning with the choice of a game orientation.

   One way of extending a two-player game to more players is by building
   two teams of equal size. A common case is four players in two fixed
--
   usually restricted to a specific list of permitted signs and signals.
   17th-century French partnership games such as triomphe were special in
   that partners sat next to each other and were allowed to communicate
--

   Another way of extending a two-player game to more players is as a
   cut-throat or individual game, in which all players play for
   themselves, and win or lose alone. Most such card games are round
   games, i.e. they can be played by any number of players starting from
   two or three, so long as there are enough cards for all.

   For some of the most interesting games such as ombre, tarot and skat,
   the associations between players change from hand to hand. Ultimately
   players all play on their own, but for each hand, some game mechanism
   divides the players into two teams. Most typically these are solo
   games, i.e. games in which one player becomes the soloist and has to
   achieve some objective against the others, who form a team and win or
   lose all their points jointly. But in games for more than three
   players, there may also be a mechanism that selects two players who
--

   The players of a card game normally form a circle around a table or
   other space that can hold cards. The game orientation or direction of
   play, which is only relevant for three or more players, can be either
   clockwise or counterclockwise. It is the direction in which various
   roles in the game proceed. (In real-time card games, there may be no
   need for a direction of play.) Most regions have a traditional
--

   Games that originate in a region with a strong preference are often
   initially played in the original direction, even in regions that prefer
   the opposite direction. For games that have official rules and are
   played in tournaments, the direction of play is often prescribed in
--

   Most games have some form of asymmetry between players. The roles of
   players are normally expressed in terms of the dealer, i.e. the player
--
   players. Being the dealer can be a (minor or major) advantage or
   disadvantage, depending on the game. Therefore, after each played hand,
   the deal normally passes to the next player according to the game
   orientation.
--
   becomes dealer. In the case of a tie, the process is repeated by the
   tied players. For some games such as whist this process of cutting is
   part of the official rules, and the hierarchy of cards for the purpose
   of cutting (which need not be the same as that used otherwise in the
   game) is also specified. But in general, any method can be used, such
   as tossing a coin in case of a two-player game, drawing cards until one
   player draws an ace, or rolling dice.

  Hands, rounds and games[edit]

   A hand, also called a deal, is a unit of the game that begins with the
   dealer shuffling and dealing the cards as described below, and ends
--
   player who sits after the dealer in the direction of play is known as
   eldest hand (or in two-player games as elder hand) or forehand. A game
   round consists of as many hands as there are players. After each hand,
--
   eldest hand becomes the new dealer. Normally players score points after
   each hand. A game may consist of a fixed number of rounds.
   Alternatively it can be played for a fixed number of points. In this
--

   For casino games that are played for large sums it is vital that the
   cards be properly randomized, but for many games this is less critical,
   and in fact player experience can suffer when the cards are shuffled
--
   dealer then offers the deck to the previous player (in the sense of the
   game direction) for cutting. If the deal is clockwise, this is the
   player to the dealer's right; if counterclockwise, it is the player to
--
   the stock (also called the talon, widow, skat or kitty depending on the
   game and region).

--
   the cards but not the other players, or vice versa depending on the
   game. It is helpful to fan one's cards out so that if they have corner
   indices all their values can be seen at once. In most games, it is also
   useful to sort one's hand, rearranging the cards in a way appropriate
   to the game. For example, in a trick-taking game it may be easier to
   have all one's cards of the same suit together, whereas in a rummy game
   one might sort them by rank or by potential combinations.
--

   A new card game starts in a small way, either as someone's invention,
   or as a modification of an existing game. Those playing it may agree to
   change the rules as they wish. The rules that they agree on become the
   "house rules" under which they play the game. A set of house rules may
   be accepted as valid by a group of players wherever they play, as it
--

   When a game becomes sufficiently popular, so that people often play it
   with strangers, there is a need for a generally accepted set of rules.
--
   There is nothing static or "official" about this process. For the
   majority of games, there is no one set of universal rules by which the
   game is played, and the most common ruleset is no more or less than
   that. Many widely played card games, such as Canasta and Pinochle, have
   no official regulating body. The most common ruleset is often
   determined by the most popular distribution of rulebooks for card
   games. Perhaps the original compilation of popular playing card games
   was collected by Edmund Hoyle, a self-made authority on many popular
   parlor games. The U.S. Playing Card Company now owns the eponymous
   Hoyle brand, and publishes a series of rulebooks for various families
   of card games that have largely standardized the games' rules in
   countries and languages where the rulebooks are widely distributed.
--

   If there is a sense in which a card game can have an official set of
   rules, it is when that card game has an "official" governing body. For
   example, the rules of tournament bridge are governed by the World
--
   down by the Schafkopfschule in Munich. Even in these cases, the rules
   must only be followed at games sanctioned by these governing bodies or
   where the tournament organisers specify them. Players in informal
--

   An infraction is any action which is against the rules of the game,
   such as playing a card when it is not one's turn to play or the
--

   In many official sets of rules for card games, the rules specifying the
   penalties for various infractions occupy more pages than the rules
   specifying how to play correctly. This is tedious but necessary for
   games that are played seriously. Players who intend to play a card game
   at a high level generally ensure before beginning that all agree on the
--

   If a player breaks the rules of a game deliberately, this is cheating.
   The rest of this section is therefore about accidental infractions,
--

   As the same game is played repeatedly among a group of players,
   precedents build up about how a particular infraction of the rules
--
   formalized, as described in the previous section. Therefore, for some
   games, there is a "proper" way of handling infractions of the rules.
   But for many games, without governing bodies, there is no standard way
   of handling infractions.
--
   who broke a rule should not benefit from it, and the other players
   should not lose by it. An exception to this may be made in games with
   fixed partnerships, in which it may be felt that the partner(s) of the

   The oldest surviving reference to the card game in world history is
   from the 9th century China, when the Collection of Miscellanea at
   Duyang, written by Tang-dynasty writer Su E, described Princess

   with members of the Wei clan (the family of the princess's husband) in

   England where it was named Beast. It was a derivative of Triomphe and

   Charlotte is one prominent British individual who is known to have

   different scoring method, became the most popular card game in the
   West.^[34]

   Based on the association of card games and gambling, Pope Benedict XIV
   banned card games on October 17, 1750.^[35]

   _Art%2C_London.jpg] The Card Players, an 1895 painting by Paul Cézanne
   depicting a card game, in Courtauld Institute of Art (London)

   A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for
   entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool.^[1]
   Many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players
   of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games
   involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video
   games).

   Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for
   achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or
--
   audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by
   watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may
   constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often,
   part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who
   is part of their audience and who is a player. A toy and a game are not
   the same. Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas games
   present rules for the player to follow.

   Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction.
   Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both.
   Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise,
   or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological

   Attested as early as 2600 BC,^[2]^[3] games are a universal part of
   human experience and present in all cultures. The Royal Game of Ur,
   Senet, and Mancala are some of the oldest known games.^[4]

   Ludwig Wittgenstein was probably the first academic philosopher to
   address the definition of the word game. In his Philosophical
   Investigations,^[5] Wittgenstein argued that the elements of games,
   such as play, rules, and competition, all fail to adequately define
   what games are. From this, Wittgenstein concluded that people apply the
   term game to a range of disparate human activities that bear to one
   another only what one might call family resemblances. As the following
   game definitions show, this conclusion was not a final one and today
   many philosophers, like Thomas Hurka, think that Wittgenstein was wrong
--
   French sociologist Roger Caillois, in his book Les jeux et les hommes
   (Games and Men)(1961),^[7] defined a game as an activity that must have
   the following characteristics:
--

   Game designer Chris Crawford defined the term in the context of
   computers.^[8] Using a series of dichotomies:
--
    3. If no goals are associated with a plaything, it is a toy. (Crawford
       notes that by his definition, (a) a toy can become a game element
       if the player makes up rules, and (b) The Sims and SimCity are
       toys, not games.) If it has goals, a plaything is a challenge.
    4. If a challenge has no "active agent against whom you compete", it
       is a puzzle; if there is one, it is a conflict. (Crawford admits
       that this is a subjective test. Video games with noticeably
       algorithmic artificial intelligence can be played as puzzles; these
--
       However, if attacks are allowed, then the conflict qualifies as a
       game.

--
   Other definitions, however, as well as history, show that entertainment
   and games are not necessarily undertaken for monetary gain.

--

     * "A game is a form of art in which participants, termed players,
       make decisions in order to manage resources through game tokens in
       the pursuit of a goal." (Greg Costikyan)^[9] According to this
       definition, some "games" that do not involve choices, such as
       Chutes and Ladders, Candy Land, and War are not technically games
       any more than a slot machine is.
     * "A game is a form of play with goals and structure." (Kevin J.
       Maroney)^[10]
     * "A game is a system in which players engage in an artificial
       conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable
       outcome." (Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman)^[11]
     * "A game is an activity among two or more independent
       decision-makers seeking to achieve their objectives in some
       limiting context." (Clark C. Abt)^[12]

   Games can be characterized by "what the player does".^[8] This is often
   referred to as gameplay. Major key elements identified in this context
   are tools and rules that define the overall context of game.

   Games are often classified by the components required to play them
   (e.g. miniatures, a ball, cards, a board and pieces, or a computer). In
   places where the use of leather is well-established, the ball has been
   a popular game piece throughout recorded history, resulting in a
   worldwide popularity of ball games such as rugby, basketball, soccer
   (football), cricket, tennis, and volleyball. Other tools are more
   idiosyncratic to a certain region. Many countries in Europe, for
   instance, have unique standard decks of playing cards. Other games such
   as chess may be traced primarily through the development and evolution
   of its game pieces.

   Many game tools are tokens, meant to represent other things. A token
   may be a pawn on a board, play money, or an intangible item such as a
--

   Games such as hide-and-seek or tag do not use any obvious tool; rather,
   their interactivity is defined by the environment. Games with the same
   or similar rules may have different gameplay if the environment is
   altered. For example, hide-and-seek in a school building differs from
   the same game in a park; an auto race can be radically different
   depending on the track or street course, even with the same cars.
--

   Games are often characterized by their tools and rules. While rules are
   subject to variations and changes, enough change in the rules usually
   results in a "new" game. For instance, baseball can be played with
   "real" baseballs or with wiffleballs. However, if the players decide to
   play with only three bases, they are arguably playing a different game.
   There are exceptions to this in that some games deliberately involve
   the changing of their own rules, but even then there are often
--

   The rules of a game may be distinguished from its aims.^[16]^[17] For
   most competitive games, the ultimate aim is winning: in this sense,
   checkmate is the aim of chess.^[18] Common win conditions are being
   first to amass a certain quota of points or tokens (as in Settlers of
   Catan), having the greatest number of tokens at the end of the game (as
   in Monopoly), or some relationship of one's game tokens to those of
   one's opponent (as in chess's checkmate). There may also be

   game, but is not alone sufficient to win the game.

--
   is not required. While meeting the aims often requires a certain degree
   of skill and (in some cases) luck, following the rules of a game merely
   requires knowledge of the rules and some careful attempt to follow
--

   A game's tools and rules will result in its requiring skill, strategy,
   luck, or a combination thereof, and are classified accordingly.

   Games of skill include games of physical skill, such as wrestling, tug
   of war, hopscotch, target shooting, and stake, and games of mental
   skill such as checkers and chess. Games of strategy include checkers,
   chess, Go, arimaa, and tic-tac-toe, and often require special equipment
   to play them. Games of chance include gambling games (blackjack,
   Mahjong, roulette, etc.), as well as snakes and ladders and rock,
   paper, scissors; most require equipment such as cards or dice. However,
   most games contain two or all three of these elements. For example,
   American football and baseball involve both physical skill and strategy
   while tiddlywinks, poker, and Monopoly combine strategy and chance.
   Many card and board games combine all three; most trick-taking games
   involve mental skill, strategy, and an element of chance, as do many
   strategic board games such as Risk, Settlers of Catan, and Carcassonne.

Single-player games

   "Single-player game" redirects here. For single-player video games, see
   Single-player video game.

   Most games require multiple players. However, single-player games are
   unique in respect to the type of challenges a player faces. Unlike a
   game with multiple players competing with or against each other to
   reach the game's goal, a one-player game is a battle solely against an
   element of the environment (an artificial opponent), against one's own
--
   playing tennis against a wall is not generally recognized as playing a
   game due to the lack of any formidable opposition. Many games described
   as "single-player" may be termed actually puzzles or recreations.

   Multiplayer video game.
   [220px-The_Card_Players_by_Lucas_van_Leyden.jpg] The Card Players by
   Lucas van Leyden (1520) depicting a multiplayer card game

   A multiplayer game is a game of several players who may be independent
   opponents or teams. Games with many independent players are difficult
   to analyze formally using game theory as the players may form and
   switch coalitions.^[19] The term "game" in this context may mean either
   a true game played for entertainment or a competitive activity
   describable in principle by mathematical game theory.

Game theory

   Main article: Game theory

   John Nash proved that games with several players have a stable solution
   provided that coalitions between players are disallowed. Nash won the
   Nobel prize for economics for this important result which extended von
   Neumann's theory of zero-sum games. Nash's stable solution is known as
   the Nash equilibrium.^[20]

   If cooperation between players is allowed, then the game becomes more
   complex; many concepts have been developed to analyze such games. While
   these have had some partial success in the fields of economics,
--

   In quantum game theory, it has been found that the introduction of
   quantum information into multiplayer games allows a new type of
   equilibrium strategy not found in traditional games. The entanglement
   of player's choices can have the effect of a contract by preventing

Lawn games

   Lawn games are outdoor games that can be played on a lawn; an area of
   mowed grass (or alternately, on graded soil) generally smaller than a
   sports field (pitch). Variations of many games that are traditionally
   played on a sports field are marketed as "lawn games" for home use in a
   front or back yard. Common lawn games include horseshoes, sholf,
   croquet, bocce, and lawn bowls.

Tabletop games

   Main article: Tabletop game

   A tabletop game is a game where the elements of play are confined to a
   small area and require little physical exertion, usually simply
   placing, picking up and moving game pieces. Most of these games are
   played at a table around which the players are seated and on which the
   game's elements are located. However, many games falling into this
   category, particularly party games, are more free-form in their play
   and can involve physical activity such as mime. Still, these games do
   not require a large area in which to play them, large amounts of

    Dexterity and coordination games

   This class of games includes any game in which the skill element
   involved relates to manual dexterity or hand-eye coordination, but
   excludes the class of video games (see below). Games such as jacks,
   paper football, and Jenga require only very portable or improvised
--
   hockey require specialized tables or other self-contained modules on
   which the game is played. The advent of home video game systems largely
   replaced some of these, such as table hockey, however air hockey,
   billiards, pinball and foosball remain popular fixtures in private and
   public game rooms. These games and others, as they require reflexes and
   coordination, are generally performed more poorly by intoxicated
   persons but are unlikely to result in injury because of this; as such
   the games are popular as drinking games. In addition, dedicated
   drinking games such as quarters and beer pong also involve physical
   coordination and are popular for similar reasons.

    Board games

   Main article: Board game

--

   Board games use as a central tool a board on which the players' status,
   resources, and progress are tracked using physical tokens. Many also
   involve dice or cards. Most games that simulate war are board games
   (though a large number of video games have been created to simulate
   strategic combat), and the board may be a map on which the players'
   tokens move. Virtually all board games involve "turn-based" play; one
   player contemplates and then makes a move, then the next player does
   the same, and a player can only act on their turn. This is opposed to
   "real-time" play as is found in some card games, most sports and most
   video games.

   Some games, such as chess and Go, are entirely deterministic, relying
   only on the strategy element for their interest. Such games are usually
   described as having "perfect information"; the only unknown is the
   exact thought processes of one's opponent, not the outcome of any
   unknown event inherent in the game (such as a card draw or die roll).
   Children's games, on the other hand, tend to be very luck-based, with
   games such as Candy Land and Chutes and Ladders having virtually no
   decisions to be made. By some definitions, such as that by Greg
   Costikyan, they are not games since there are no decisions to make
   which affect the outcome.^[9] Many other games involving a high degree
   of luck do not allow direct attacks between opponents; the random event
   simply determines a gain or loss in the standing of the current player
   within the game, which is independent of any other player; the "game"
   then is actually a "race" by definitions such as Crawford's.

   Most other board games combine strategy and luck factors; the game of
   backgammon requires players to decide the best strategic move based on
   the roll of two dice. Trivia games have a great deal of randomness
   based on the questions a person gets. German-style board games are
   notable for often having rather less of a luck factor than many board
   games.

   Board game groups include race games, roll-and-move games, abstract
   strategy games, word games, and wargames, as well as trivia and other
   elements. Some board games fall into multiple groups or incorporate
   elements of other genres: Cranium is one popular example, where players
--

    Card games

   Main article: Card game

   Further information: Collectible card game

--

   Card games use a deck of cards as their central tool. These cards may
   be a standard Anglo-American (52-card) deck of playing cards (such as
   for bridge, poker, Rummy, etc.), a regional deck using 32, 36 or
   40 cards and different suit signs (such as for the popular German game
   skat), a tarot deck of 78 cards (used in Europe to play a variety of
   trick-taking games collectively known as Tarot, Tarock or Tarocchi
   games), or a deck specific to the individual game (such as Set or 1000
   Blank White Cards). Uno and Rook are examples of games that were
   originally played with a standard deck and have since been
   commercialized with customized decks. Some collectible card games such
   as Magic: The Gathering are played with a small selection of cards that
--

   Some board games include a deck of cards as a gameplay element,
   normally for randomization or to keep track of game progress.
   Conversely, some card games such as Cribbage use a board with movers,
   normally to keep score. The differentiation between the two genres in
   such cases depends on which element of the game is foremost in its
   play; a board game using cards for random actions can usually use some
   other method of randomization, while Cribbage can just as easily be
--

    Dice games

   Main article: Dice game

--

   Dice games use a number of dice as their central element. Board games
   often use dice for a randomization element, and thus each roll of the
   dice has a profound impact on the outcome of the game, however dice
   games are differentiated in that the dice do not determine the success
   or failure of some other element of the game; they instead are the
   central indicator of the person's standing in the game. Popular dice
   games include Yahtzee, Farkle, Bunco, Liar's dice/Perudo, and Poker
   dice. As dice are, by their very nature, designed to produce apparently
   random numbers, these games usually involve a high degree of luck,
   which can be directed to some extent by the player through more
   strategic elements of play and through tenets of probability theory.
   Such games are thus popular as gambling games; the game of Craps is
   perhaps the most famous example, though Liar's dice and Poker dice were
   originally conceived of as gambling games.

    Domino and tile games

   Main articles: Tile-based game and Dominoes

   Domino games are similar in many respects to card games, but the
   generic device is instead a set of tiles called dominoes, which
--
   "pips", and each combination of two possible end values as it appears
   on a tile is unique in the set. The games played with dominoes largely
   center around playing a domino from the player's "hand" onto the

   theory but are triangular and thus have three values per tile.
   Similarly, a game known as Quad-Ominos uses four-sided tiles.

   Some other games use tiles in place of cards; Rummikub is a variant of
   the Rummy card game family that uses tiles numbered in ascending rank
   among four colors, very similar in makeup to a 2-deck "pack" of
   Anglo-American playing cards. Mahjong is another game very similar to
   Rummy that uses a set of tiles with card-like values and art.

   Lastly, some games use graphical tiles to form a board layout, on which
   other elements of the game are played. Settlers of Catan and
   Carcassonne are examples. In each, the "board" is made up of a series
   of tiles; in Settlers of Catan the starting layout is random but
   static, while in Carcassonne the game is played by "building" the board
   tile-by-tile. Hive, an abstract strategy game using tiles as moving
   pieces, has mechanical and strategic elements similar to chess,

    Pencil and paper games

   Main article: Paper-and-pencil game

   Pencil and paper games require little or no specialized equipment other
   than writing materials, though some such games have been commercialized
   as board games (Scrabble, for instance, is based on the idea of a
   crossword puzzle, and tic-tac-toe sets with a boxed grid and pieces are
   available commercially). These games vary widely, from games centering
   on a design being drawn such as Pictionary and "connect-the-dots" games
   like sprouts, to letter and word games such as Boggle and
   Scattergories, to solitaire and logic puzzle games such as Sudoku and
   crossword puzzles.

    Guessing games

   Main article: Guessing game

   A guessing game has as its core a piece of information that one player
   knows, and the object is to coerce others into guessing that piece of
   information without actually divulging it in text or spoken word.
   Charades is probably the most well-known game of this type, and has
   spawned numerous commercial variants that involve differing rules on
   the type of communication to be given, such as Catch Phrase, Taboo,
   Pictionary, and similar. The genre also includes many game shows such
   as Win, Lose or Draw, Password and $25,000 Pyramid.

  Video games

   Main article: Video game

   See also: Electronic game

   Video games are computer- or microprocessor-controlled games. Computers
   can create virtual spaces for a wide variety of game types. Some video
   games simulate conventional game objects like cards or dice, while
   others can simulate environs either grounded in reality or fantastical
--

   A computer or video game uses one or more input devices, typically a
   button/joystick combination (on arcade games); a keyboard, mouse or
   trackball (computer games); or a controller or a motion sensitive tool
   (console games). More esoteric devices such as paddle controllers have
   also been used for input.

   There are many genres of video game; the first commercial video game,
   Pong, was a simple simulation of table tennis. As processing power
   increased, new genres such as adventure and action games were developed
   that involved a player guiding a character from a third person
   perspective through a series of obstacles. This "real-time" element
   cannot be easily reproduced by a board game, which is generally limited
   to "turn-based" strategy; this advantage allows video games to simulate
   situations such as combat more realistically. Additionally, the playing
   of a video game does not require the same physical skill, strength or
   danger as a real-world representation of the game, and can provide
   either very realistic, exaggerated or impossible physics, allowing for
   elements of a fantastical nature, games involving physical violence, or
   simulations of sports. Lastly, a computer can, with varying degrees of
   success, simulate one or more human opponents in traditional table
   games such as chess, leading to simulations of such games that can be
   played by a single player.
--
   In more open-ended computer simulations, also known as sandbox-style
   games, the game provides a virtual environment in which the player may
   be free to do whatever they like within the confines of this universe.
   Sometimes, there is a lack of goals or opposition, which has stirred
   some debate on whether these should be considered "games" or "toys".

    Online games

   Main article: Online game

   Online games have been part of culture from the very earliest days of
   networked and time-shared computers. Early commercial systems such as
   Plato were at least as widely famous for their games as for their
   strictly educational value. In 1958, Tennis for Two dominated Visitor's

   Modern online games are played using an Internet connection; some have
   dedicated client programs, while others require only a web browser.
   Some simpler browser games appeal to more casual game-playing
   demographic groups (notably older audiences) that otherwise play very
   few video games.^[22]

  Role-playing games

   Main article: Role-playing game

   Role-playing games, often abbreviated as RPGs, are a type of game in
   which the participants (usually) assume the roles of characters acting
   in a fictional setting. The original role playing games – or at least
   those explicitly marketed as such – are played with a handful of

   setting; or vicariously experience an adventure outside the bounds of
   everyday life. Pen-and-paper role-playing games include, for example,
   Dungeons &amp Dragons and GURPS.

   The term role-playing game has also been appropriated by the video game
   industry to describe a genre of video games. These may be single-player
   games where one player experiences a programmed environment and story,
   or they may allow players to interact through the internet. The
   experience is usually quite different from traditional role-playing
   games. Single-player games include Final Fantasy, Fable, The Elder
   Scrolls, and Mass Effect. Online multi-player games, often referred to
   as Massively Multiplayer Online role playing games, or MMORPGs, include
   RuneScape, EverQuest 2, Guild Wars, MapleStory, Anarchy Online, and

  Business games

--

   Business games can take a variety of forms, from interactive board
   games to interactive games involving different props (balls, ropes,
   hoops, etc.) and different kinds of activities. The purpose of these
   games is to link to some aspect of organizational performance and to
   generate discussions about business improvement. Many business games
   focus on organizational behaviors. Some of these are computer

   Main article: Simulation game

   The term "game" can include simulation^[24]^[25] or re-enactment of
   various activities or use in "real life" for various purposes: e.g.,
   training, analysis, prediction. Well-known examples are war games and
   role-playing. The root of this meaning may originate in the human
   prehistory of games deduced by anthropology from observing primitive
   cultures, in which children's games mimic the activities of adults to a
   significant degree: hunting, warring, nursing, etc. These kinds of
   games are preserved in modern times.^[original research?]

11 Benefits to Playing Games in the Classroom (Resources Included)

--

   Research has shown that there are many benefits to playing games in the
   classroom. When planning lessons, teachers should try to incorporate at
   least one game a day into one of the key learning areas as either a
   teaching and learning tool, assessment strategy or classroom motivator.
--

   When playing games, students become more engaged in their learning,
   taught content is reinforced and class positivity is increased.
--
   In this blog we have outlined ten of the most important benefits
   students gain from playing games in the classroom. We have also
   selected some of our most popular Numeracy, Literacy, Technology,

10 Benefits to Playing Games in the Classroom

--

   Playing games in the classroom increases overall motivation. By playing
   games, students become more motivated to learn, pay attention and
   participate in set tasks. Games help students to become a part of a
   team as well as take responsibility for their own learning. They can
--
   Students can become very competitive in the classroom, especially boys.
   Games are a great way to control the competitiveness between peers.

   By using games in the classroom, students can compete against each
   other whilst playing a game, then support each other during other
   learning activities.
--

   Most games require problem-solving strategies and planning. By applying
   a range of strategies in a game, students are able to use their working
   memory to solve problems, increasing their mental cognition.
   Stimulating the brain with strategies in a game can be a great brain
   workout!
--

   Using games in a lesson as part of teaching and learning helps to
   create positivity around the lesson, motivating students with their
--

   Games can also create a positive memory and experience of learning for
   students in the classroom.
--

   As an alternative to worksheets, games can be used as a less stressful
   way for students to demonstrate their knowledge, skill and
--

   Playing a range of content-specific games can increase memory! As they
   play a game, students need to remember important details about a topic
   but also use their working memory to think and act quickly.

   Games that were made by the students can be some of the most effective.
   As students construct a game they are required to use their memory of
   specific content to create questions and answers suitable for the game,
   then use their memory of the topic to play the game.

--

   Playing games in the classroom increases class cooperation. Classroom
   games can also be used as a team-building exercise!

   Students need to work together as a team when playing as a whole class
   against the teacher, or in small team groups when playing games with
   each other.
--

   Playing games requires students to pay great attention to detail. As
   games can move quickly, when playing a game a student needs to be alert
   and attentive.

   This attentiveness when playing a game can help students to stay
   focused on other tasks in the classroom throughout the day.
--

   Playing games in the classroom is always great fun!

   When playing a game, endorphins are produced that stimulate the brain
   and gives students a feeling of euphoria. This feeling of euphoria
--

   Games are a great tool to use in the classroom to consolidate new
   knowledge.

   After teaching new content to the class, provide students with a game
   that will consolidate their understanding and make connections with
   what they already know. Asking students to create their own
   content-specific games can also be a great way to assess students at
   the end of a unit of work.
--

   Games aren’t just for inside the classroom. Going outside and enjoying
   the outdoors can also provide a bit of brain break for your students,

Strategy (game theory)

--
   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Complete plan on how a game player will behave in every possible game
   situation
--

   In game theory, a player's strategy is any of the options which they
   choose in a setting where the optimal outcome depends not only on their
   own actions but on the actions of others.^[1] The discipline mainly
   concerns the action of a player in a game affecting the behavior or
   actions of other players. Some examples of "games" include chess,
   bridge, poker, monopoly, diplomacy or battleship.^[2] A player's
   strategy will determine the action which the player will take at any
   stage of the game. In studying game theory, economists enlist a more
   rational lens in analyzing decisions rather than the psychological or
--
   move. A move is an action taken by a player at some point during the
   play of a game (e.g., in chess, moving white's Bishop a2 to b3). A
   strategy on the other hand is a complete algorithm for playing the
   game, telling a player what to do for every possible situation
   throughout the game. It is helpful to think about a "strategy" as a
   list of directions, and a "move" as a single turn on the list of
--
   of strategies for all players which fully specifies all actions in a
   game. A strategy profile must include one and only one strategy for
   every player.
--
   A player has a finite strategy set if they have a number of discrete
   strategies available to them. For instance, a game of rock paper
   scissors comprises a single move by each player—and each player's move
--
   A strategy set is infinite otherwise. For instance the cake cutting
   game has a bounded continuum of strategies in the strategy set {Cut
   anywhere between zero percent and 100 percent of the cake}.

   In a dynamic game, games that are played over a series of time, the
   strategy set consists of the possible rules a player could give to a
   robot or agent on how to play the game. For instance, in the ultimatum
   game, the strategy set for the second player would consist of every
   possible rule for which offers to accept and which to reject.

   In a Bayesian game, or games in which players have incomplete
   information about one another, the strategy set is similar to that in a
   dynamic game. It consists of rules for what action to take for any
   possible private information.
--

   In applied game theory, the definition of the strategy sets is an
   important part of the art of making a game simultaneously solvable and
   meaningful. The game theorist can use knowledge of the overall problem,
   that is the friction between two or more players, to limit the strategy
--

   For instance, strictly speaking in the Ultimatum game a player can have
   strategies such as: Reject offers of ($1, $3, $5, ..., $19), accept
--
   for a very large strategy space and a somewhat difficult problem. A
   game theorist might instead believe they can limit the strategy set to:
   {Reject any offer ≤ x, accept any offer >gt x; for x in ($0, $1, $2, ...,
--
   A pure strategy provides a complete definition of how a player will
   play a game. Pure strategy can be thought about as a singular concrete
   plan subject to the observations they make during the course of the
   game of play. In particular, it determines the move a player will make
   for any situation they could face. A player's strategy set is the set
--
   A mixed strategy is an assignment of a probability to each pure
   strategy. When enlisting mixed strategy, it is often because the game
   doesn't allow for a rational description in specifying a pure strategy
   for the game. This allows for a player to randomly select a pure
   strategy. (See the following section for an illustration.) Since

   best at shooting, which is left if they are right-footed. The matrix
   for the soccer game illustrates this situation, a simplified form of
   the game studied by Chiappori, Levitt, and Groseclose (2002).^[3] It
   assumes that if the goalie guesses correctly, the kick is blocked,
--
          Kick Right +1, -1     0,  0
    Payoff for the Soccer Game (Kicker, Goalie)

   This game has no pure-strategy equilibrium, because one player or the
   other would deviate from any profile of strategies—for example, (Left,
--
   In his famous paper, John Forbes Nash proved that there is an
   equilibrium for every finite game. One can divide Nash equilibria into
   two types. Pure strategy Nash equilibria are Nash equilibria where all
--
   equilibria where at least one player is playing a mixed strategy. While
   Nash proved that every finite game has a Nash equilibrium, not all have
   pure strategy Nash equilibria. For an example of a game that does not
   have a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies, see Matching pennies.
   However, many games do have pure strategy Nash equilibria (e.g. the
   Coordination game, the Prisoner's dilemma, the Stag hunt). Further,
   games can have both pure strategy and mixed strategy equilibria. An
   easy example is the pure coordination game, where in addition to the
   pure strategies (A,A) and (B,B) a mixed equilibrium exists in which
--
   equilibrium strategy probability or deviate to some other
   probability.^[4] ^[5] Game theorist Ariel Rubinstein describes
   alternative ways of understanding the concept. The first, due to
--
   payoff-irrelevant exogenous factors.^[5] A second interpretation
   imagines the game players standing for a large population of agents.
   Each of the agents chooses a pure strategy, and the payoff depends on
--
   each player to actually play a pure strategy of Rock in each play of
   the game, even though over time the probabilities are those of the
   mixed strategy.
--
   two concepts are very closely related in the context of normal form
   games, they have very different implications for extensive form games.
   Roughly, a mixed strategy randomly chooses a deterministic path through
   the game tree, while a behavior strategy can be seen as a stochastic
   path. The relationship between mixed and behavior strategies is the
   subject of Kuhn's theorem, a behavioral outlook on traditional
   game-theoretic hypotheses. The result establishes that in any finite
   extensive-form game with perfect recall, for any player and any mixed
   strategy, there exists a behavior strategy that, against all profiles
--
   is given by Piccione and Rubinstein (1997)^[full citation needed] with
   their Absent-Minded Driver game.

--

   Perfect recall is defined as the ability of every player in game to
   remember and recall all past actions within the game. Perfect recall is
   required for equivalence as, in finite games with imperfect recall,
   there will be existing mixed strategies of Player I in which there is
   no equivalent behavior strategy. This is fully described in the
   Absent-Minded Driver game formulated by Piccione and Rubinstein. In
   short, this game is based on the decision-making of a driver with
   imperfect recall, who needs to take the second exit off the highway to
   reach home but does not remember which intersection they are at when
   they reach it. Figure [2] describes this game.

--
   outcomes that their behavioral strategy cannot, and vice versa. This is
   demonstrated in the Absent-minded Driver game. With perfect recall and
   information, the driver has a single pure strategy, which is [continue,
--
   continuing at both intersections, maximized at p=2/3 (reference). This
   simple one player game demonstrates the importance of perfect recall
   for outcome equivalence, and its impact on normal and extended form
   games.^[9]

   Common pheasant, widely introduced and hunted as game

   Game or quarry is any wild animal hunted for animal products (primarily
   meat), for recreation ("sporting"), or for trophies.^[1] The species of
   animals hunted as game varies in different parts of the world and by
   different local jurisdictions, though most are terrestrial mammals and
   birds. Fish caught non-commercially (recreational fishing) are also
   referred to as game fish.

   In some countries, game is classified, including legal classifications
   with respect to licenses required, as either "small game" or "large
   game". A single small game licence may cover all small game species and
   be subject to yearly bag limits. Large game are often subject to
   individual licensing where a separate permit is required for each

   In the UK game is defined in law by the Game Act 1831. It is illegal to
   shoot game on Sundays or at night. Other non-game birds that are hunted
   for food in the UK are specified under the Wildlife and Countryside Act
   1981. UK law defines game as including:

   Game meat is typically taken from a wild animal that has been shot with
   a gun or bow. Hunters must be absolutely certain of their target before
   shooting and should make every effort to get the animal down as quickly
   and painlessly as possible. Once obtained, game meat must be processed
   to avoid spoiling. The method of processing varies by game species and
   size. Small game and fowl may simply be carried home to be butchered.
   Large game such as deer is quickly field-dressed by removing the
   viscera in the field, while very large animals like moose may be
--

   Traditionally, game meat was hung until "high" or "gamey", that is,
   approaching a state of decomposition.^[4] However, this adds to the
   risk of contamination. Small game can be processed essentially intact,
   after gutting and skinning or defeathering (by species). Small animals
   are ready for cooking, although they may be disjointed first. Large
   game must be processed by techniques commonly practiced by commercial
   butchers.

   Generally game is cooked in the same ways as farmed meat.^[5] Because
   some game meat is leaner than store-bought beef, overcooking is a
   common mishap which can be avoided if properly prepared.^[6]^[7] It is
   sometimes grilled or cooked longer or by slow cooking or moist-heat
   methods to make it more tender, since some game tends to be tougher
   than farm-raised meat. Other methods of tenderizing include marinating
   as in the dish Hasenpfeffer, cooking in a game pie or as a stew such as
   burgoo.

   Archery Hunting for Small Game

   Unlike big game hunting, where there are typically separate seasons for
   firearms and archery equipment, there are no legal incentives to hunt
   small game with a bow. There are a few exceptions to this rule,
   including an archery-only duck hunt on a coastal refuge in the vicinity

   Instead, the decision to hunt small game with a bow typically comes
   down to personal aesthetics. Some hunters value a challenge as much or

   fast-shooting compound bow. What’s more, by using the same bow for both
   big game and small game hunting, you’ll be practicing for big game
   hunting while chasing small game, and vice-versa.

   Traditional vs Compound
   But if you’re considering a bow purchase strictly for small game, and
   more particularly for flushed rabbits and game birds, you should
   consider going with a traditional recurve or longbow that will allow
   you to take snapshots at the fast-moving game. A compound bow must be
   held at full draw to aim and fire; this takes time and prevents snap
   shooting. Here are some additional pros and cons to consider when
   purchasing a bow that you’ll use for small game hunting.

   For adults, if you want things to get a little wild, just add alcohol.
   For most games, instead of someone being "out" after losing, have them
   take a sip of their drink (or a shot, if you're feeling particularly
   rowdy). In games involving rule-making (Kings, Cheers to the Governor,
   etc.), any rule can be turned into an instruction to drink: Women
   drink, men drink, people wearing black drink, etc. If you are
   introducing drinking games to your gathering, drink responsibly, and
   stay safe. (And don't forget to offer non-alcoholic mocktail options

   This game is also known as Assassin, Werewolf, or Village. If you have
   a large group, a deck of cards, a lot of time, and long attention

   A video game^[a] or computer game is an electronic game that involves
   interaction with a user interface or input device (such as a joystick,
--
   touchscreen on handheld devices, or a virtual reality headset. Most
   modern video games are audiovisual, with audio complement delivered
   through speakers or headphones, and sometimes also with other types of
   sensory feedback (e.g., haptic technology that provides tactile
   sensations), and some video games also allow microphone and webcam
   inputs for in-game chatting and livestreaming.

   Video games are typically categorized according to their hardware
   platform, which traditionally includes arcade video games, console
   games, and computer (PC) games; the latter also encompasses LAN games,
   online games, and browser games. More recently, the video game industry
   has expanded onto mobile gaming through mobile devices (such as
   smartphones and tablet computers), virtual and augmented reality
   systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are also classified into
   a wide range of genres based on their style of gameplay and target

   The first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s were simple
   extensions of electronic games using video-like output from large,
   room-sized mainframe computers. The first consumer video game was the
   arcade video game Computer Space in 1971. In 1972 came the iconic hit
   game Pong and the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. The
   industry grew quickly during the "golden age" of arcade video games
   from the late 1970s to early 1980s but suffered from the crash of the
   North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of publishing
   control and saturation of the market. Following the crash, the industry

   and Sony, and established practices and methods around the development
   and distribution of video games to prevent a similar crash in the
   future, many of which continue to be followed. In the 2000s, the core
   industry centered on "AAA" games, leaving little room for riskier
   experimental games. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and
   digital distribution, this gave room for independent video game
   development (or "indie games") to gain prominence into the 2010s. Since
   then, the commercial importance of the video game industry has been
   increasing. The emerging Asian markets and proliferation of smartphone
   games in particular are altering player demographics towards casual
   gaming and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service.

   Today, video game development requires numerous interdisciplinary
   skills, vision, teamwork, and liaisons between different parties,
   including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, hardware
   manufacturers, and other marketers, to successfully bring a game to its
   consumers. As of 2020^[update], the global video game market had
   estimated annual revenues of US$159 billion across hardware, software,

   it a formidable heavyweight across the modern entertainment industry.
   The video game market is also a major influence behind the electronics
   industry, where personal computer component, console, and peripheral
   sales, as well as consumer demands for better game performance, have
   been powerful driving factors for hardware design and innovation.

   The term "video game" was developed to distinguish this class of
   electronic games that were played on some type of video display rather
   than on a teletype printer, audio speaker or similar device.^[13] This
   also distinguished from many handheld electronic games like Merlin
   which commonly used LED lights for indicators but did not use these in

   "Computer game" may also be used as a descriptor, as all these types of
   games essentially require the use of a computer processor, and in some
   cases, it is used interchangeably with "video game".^[15] Particularly
   in the United Kingdom and Western Europe, this is common due to the
   historic relevance of domestically produced microcomputers. Other terms
   used include digital game, for example by the Australian Bureau of
   Statistics.^[16] However, the term "computer game" can also be used to
   more specifically refer to games played primarily on personal computers
   or other type of flexible hardware systems (also known as a PC game),
   as a way distinguish them from console games, arcade games or mobile
   games.^[14]^[13] Other terms such as "television game" or "telegame"
   had been used in the 1970s and early 1980s, particularly for the home

   made within the country by the large television manufacturers such as
   Toshiba and Sharp Corporation, such games are known as "TV games", or
   TV geemu or terebi geemu.^[18] "Electronic game" may also be used to
   refer to video games, but this also incorporates devices like early
   handheld electronic games that lack any video output.^[15] and the term
   "TV game" is still commonly used into the 21st century.^[18]^[19]

   The first appearance of the term "video game" emerged around 1973. The
   Oxford English Dictionary cited a 10 November 1973 BusinessWeek article
--
   March 1973 in these magazines in mass usage including by the arcade
   game manufacturers. As analyzed by video game historian Keith Smith,
   the sudden appearance suggested that the term had been proposed and
--
   In a September 1982 issue of RePlay, Adlum is credited with first
   naming these games as "video games": "RePlay's Eddie Adlum worked at
   'Cash Box' when 'TV games' first came out. The personalities in those
   days were Bushnell, his sales manager Pat Karns and a handful of other
   'TV game' manufacturers like Henry Leyser and the McEwan brothers. It
   seemed awkward to call their products 'TV games', so borrowing a word
   from Billboard's description of movie jukeboxes, Adlum started to refer
   to this new breed of amusement machine as 'video games.' The phrase
   stuck."^[citation needed] Adlum explained in 1985 that up until the
   early 1970s, amusement arcades typically had non-video arcade games
   such as pinball machines and electro-mechanical games. With the arrival
   of video games in arcades during the early 1970s, there was initially
   some confusion in the arcade industry over what term should be used to
   describe the new games. He "wrestled with descriptions of this type of
   game," alternating between "TV game" and "television game" but "finally
   woke up one day" and said, "what the hell... video game!"^[22]

   representation of such a vital resource. In addition to collecting home
   video game consoles, the Electronics Conservancy organization set out
   to locate and restore 400 antique arcade cabinets after realizing that
   the majority of these games had been destroyed and feared the loss of
   their historical significance.^[23] Video games have significantly
   began to be seen in the real-world as a purpose to present history in a

   the public perceives the past, and digital humanists encourage
   historians to use video games as primary materials.^[24] Video games,
   considering their past and age, have over time progressed as what a

   hand-held device, there are many ways that video games are being
   displayed for users to enjoy. People have drawn comparisons between

   While many games readily fall into a clear, well-understood definition
   of video games, new genres and innovations in game development have
   raised the question of what are the essential factors of a video game
   that separate the medium from other forms of entertainment.

   The introduction of interactive films in the 1980s with games like
   Dragon's Lair, featured games with full motion video played off a form
   of media but only limited user interaction.^[28] This had required a
   means to distinguish these games from more traditional board games that
   happen to also use external media, such as the Clue VCR Mystery Game
   which required players to watch VCR clips between turns. To distinguish
   between these two, video games are considered to require some
   interactivity that affects the visual display.^[14]

   Most video games tend to feature some type of victory or winning
   conditions, such as a scoring mechanism or a final boss fight. The
   introduction of walking simulators (adventure games that allow for
   exploration but lack any objectives) like Gone Home, and empathy games
   (video games that tend to focus on emotion) like That Dragon, Cancer
   brought the idea of games that did not have any such type of winning
   condition and raising the question of whether these were actually
   games.^[29] These are still commonly justified as video games as they
   provide a game world that the player can interact with by some
   means.^[30]

   The lack of any industry definition for a video game by 2021 was an
   issue during the case Epic Games v. Apple which dealt with video games
   offered on Apple's iOS App Store. Among concerns raised were games like
   Fortnite Creative and Roblox which created metaverses of interactive
   experiences, and whether the larger game and the individual experiences
   themselves were games or not in relation to fees that Apple charged for
   the App Store. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, recognizing that there was
   yet an industry standard definition for a video game, established for
   her ruling that "At a bare minimum, videogames appear to require some
   level of interactivity or involvement between the player and the
   medium" compared to passive entertainment like film, music, and
   television, and "videogames are also generally graphically rendered or
   animated, as opposed to being recorded live or via motion capture as in
   films or television".^[31] Rogers still concluded that what is a video
   game "appears highly eclectic and diverse".^[31]

   The gameplay experience varies radically between video games, but many
   common elements exist. Most games will launch into a title screen and

   which the player must work the avatar through, scoring points,

   between levels will offer save points where the player can create a

   their lives or need to stop the game and restart at a later time. These

   cartridges allow players to execute these cheat codes, and
   user-developed trainers allow similar bypassing for computer software
   games. Both of which might make the game easier, give the player
   additional power-ups, or change the appearance of the game.^[33]

   Video games require a platform, a specific combination of electronic
   components or computer hardware and associated software, to
   operate.^[37] The term system is also commonly used. Games are
   typically designed to be played on one or a limited number of
   platforms, and exclusivity to a platform is used as a competitive edge
   in the video game market.^[38] However, games may be developed for
   alternative platforms than intended, which are described as ports or
   conversions. These also may be remasters - where most of the original
   game's source code is reused and art assets, models, and game levels
   are updated for modern systems – and remakes, where in addition to
   asset improvements, significant reworking of the original game and
   possibly from scratch is performed.^[39]

          specialized electronic device that connects to a common
          television set or composite video monitor. Home consoles are
          specifically designed to play games using a dedicated hardware
          environment, giving developers a concrete hardware target for
          development and assurances of what features will be available,
          simplifying development compared to PC game development. Usually
          consoles only run games developed for it, or games from other
          platform made by the same company, but never games developed by
          its direct competitor, even if the same game is available on

   Handheld console
          A handheld game console is a small, self-contained electronic

          features the console, a small screen, speakers and buttons,
          joystick or other game controllers in a single unit. Like
          consoles, handhelds are dedicated platforms, and share almost
          the same characteristics. Handheld hardware usually is less
          powerful than PC or console hardware. Some handheld games from
          the late 1970s and early 1980s could only play one game. In the
          1990s and 2000s, a number of handheld games used cartridges,
          which enabled them to be used to play many different games. The

          police-themed arcade game in which players use a light gun An
          arcade video game generally refers to a game played on an even
          more specialized type of electronic device that is typically
          designed to play only one game and is encased in a special,
          large coin-operated cabinet which has one built-in console,
          controllers (joystick, buttons, etc.), a CRT screen, and audio
          amplifier and speakers. Arcade games often have brightly painted
          logos and images relating to the theme of the game. While most
          arcade games are housed in a vertical cabinet, which the user
          typically stands in front of to play, some arcade games use a
          tabletop approach, in which the display screen is housed in a
          table-style cabinet with a see-through table top. With table-top
          games, the users typically sit to play. In the 1990s and 2000s,
          some arcade games offered players a choice of multiple games. In
          the 1980s, video arcades were businesses in which game players
          could use a number of arcade video games. In the 2010s, there

   Browser game
          A browser game takes advantages of standardizations of
          technologies for the functionality of web browsers across
          multiple devices providing a cross-platform environment. These
          games may be identified based on the website that they appear,
          such as with Miniclip games. Others are named based on the
          programming platform used to develop them, such as Java and
          Flash games.

   Mobile game
          With the introduction of smartphones and tablet computers
          standardized on the iOS and Android operating systems, mobile

   Emulation
          An emulator enables games from a console or otherwise different
          system to be run in a type of virtual machine on a modern
          system, simulating the hardware of the original and allows old
          games to be played. While emulators themselves have been found
          to be legal in United States case law, the act of obtaining the
          game software that one does not already own may violate
          copyrights. However, there are some official releases of
          emulated software from game manufacturers, such as Nintendo with
          its Virtual Console or Nintendo Switch Online offerings.

          Backward compatibility is similar in nature to emulation in that
          older games can be played on newer platforms, but typically
          directly though hardware and build-in software within the
          platform. For example, the PlayStation 2 is capable of playing

   [220px-NES-Cartridge.jpg] An unlabeled game cartridge for the Nintendo
   Entertainment System

   Early arcade games, home consoles, and handheld games were dedicated
   hardware units with the game's logic built into the electronic
   componentry of the hardware. Since then, most video game platforms are
   considered programmable, having means to read and play multiple games
   distributed on different types of media or formats. Physical formats
--
   alleviate the need for any physical media. In some cases, the media
   serves as the direct read-only memory for the game, or it may be the
   form of installation media that is used to write the main assets to the
--

   Games can be extended with new content and software patches through
   either expansion packs which are typically available as physical media,
--
   distribution. These can be offered freely or can be used to monetize a
   game following its initial release. Several games offer players the
   ability to create user-generated content to share with others to play.
   Other games, mostly those on personal computers, can be extended with
   user-created modifications or mods that alter or add onto the game;
   these often are unofficial and were developed by players from reverse
   engineering of the game, but other games provide official support for
   modding the game.^[43]

   Video game can use several types of input devices to translate human
   actions to a game. Most common are the use of game controllers like
   gamepads and joysticks for most consoles, and as accessories for
--
   onto arcade cabinets. Newer technology improvements have incorporated
   additional technology into the controller or the game platform, such as
   touchscreens and motion detection sensors that give more options for
   how the player interacts with the game. Specialized controllers may be
   used for certain genres of games, including racing wheels, light guns
   and dance pads. Digital cameras and motion detection can capture
   movements of the player as input into the game, which can, in some
   cases, effectively eliminate the control, and on other systems such as
   virtual reality, are used to enhance immersion into the game.

   Main article: Video game graphics

   [170px-Game-Boy-FL.jpg] Handheld units, like the Game Boy, include
   built-in output screens and sound speakers.

   By definition, all video games are intended to output graphics to an
   external video display, such as cathode-ray tube televisions, newer
--
   projectors or computer monitors, depending on the type of platform the
   game is played on. Features such as color depth, refresh rate, frame
   rate, and screen resolution are a combination of the limitations of the
   game platform and display device and the program efficiency of the game
   itself. The game's output can range from fixed displays using LED or
   LCD elements, text-based games, two-dimensional and three-dimensional
   graphics, and augmented reality displays.

   The game's graphics are often accompanied by sound produced by internal
   speakers on the game platform or external speakers attached to the
   platform, as directed by the game's programming. This often will
   include sound effects tied to the player's actions to provide audio
   feedback, as well as background music for the game.

   Some platforms support additional feedback mechanics to the player that
   a game can take advantage of. This is most commonly haptic technology
   built into the game controller, such as causing the controller to shake
   in the player's hands to simulate a shaking earthquake occurring in
   game.

   Video games are frequently classified by a number of factors related to
   how one plays them.

   Main article: Video game genre

--

   Dustforce is representative of the platform game genre as its gameplay
   involves jumping between platforms.

   A video game, like most other forms of media, may be categorized into
   genres. However, unlike film or television which use visual or
   narrative elements, video games are generally categorized into genres
   based on their gameplay interaction, since this is the primary means
   which one interacts with a video game.^[45]^[46]^[47] The narrative
   setting does not impact gameplay; a shooter game is still a shooter
   game, regardless of whether it takes place in a fantasy world or in
   outer space.^[48]^[49] An exception is the horror game genre, used for
   games that are based on narrative elements of horror fiction, the
   supernatural, and psychological horror.^[50]
--
   Genre names are normally self-describing in terms of the type of
   gameplay, such as action game, role playing game, or shoot 'em up,
   though some genres have derivations from influential works that have
   defined that genre, such as roguelikes from Rogue,^[51] Grand Theft
   Auto clones from Grand Theft Auto III,^[52] and battle royale games
   from the film Battle Royale.^[53] The names may shift over time as
--
   first-person shooters were originally called "Doom clones" based on the
   1993 game.^[54] A hierarchy of game genres exist, with top-level genres
   like "shooter game" and "action game" that broadly capture the game's
   main gameplay style, and several subgenres of specific implementation,
   such as within the shooter game first-person shooter and third-person
   shooter. Some cross-genre types also exist that fall until multiple
   top-level genres such as action-adventure game.

   A video game's mode describes how many players can use the game at the
   same type. This is primarily distinguished by single-player video games
   and multiplayer video games. Within the latter category, multiplayer
   games can be played in a variety of ways, including locally at the same
   device, on separate devices connected through a local network such as
   LAN parties, or online via separate Internet connections. Most
   multiplayer games are based on competitive gameplay, but many offer
   cooperative and team-based options as well as asymmetric gameplay.
   Online games use server structures that can also enable massively
   multiplayer online games (MMOs) to support hundreds of players at the
   same time.

   A small number of video games are zero-player games, in which the
   player has very limited interaction with the game itself. These are
   most commonly simulation games where the player may establish a
   starting state and then let the game proceed on its own, watching the
   results as a passive observer, such as with many computerized
   simulations of Conway's Game of Life.^[55]

--

   Most video games are intended for entertainment purposes.^[36]
   Different game types include:

   Core games
          Core or hard-core games refer to the typical perception of video
          games, developed for entertainment purposes. These games
          typically require a fair amount of time to learn and master, in
          contrast to casual games, and thus are most appealing to gamers
          rather than a broader audience. Most of the AAA video game
          industry is based around the delivery of core games.^[56]

   Casual games
          In contrast to core games, casual games are designed for ease of
          accessibility, simple to understand gameplay and quick to grasp
--
          as during commuting or lunch breaks. Numerous browser and mobile
          games fall into the casual game area, and casual games often are
          from genres with low intensity game elements such as match
          three, hidden object, time management, and puzzle games.^[57]
          Causal games frequently use social-network game mechanics, where
          players can enlist the help of friends on their social media
          networks for extra turns or moves each day.^[58] Popular casual
          games include Tetris and Candy Crush Saga. More recent, starting
          in the late 2010s, are hyper-casual games which use even more
          simplistic rules for short but infinitely replayable games, such
          as Flappy Bird.^[59]

   Educational games
          Education software has been used in homes and classrooms to help
          teach children and students, and video games have been similarly
          adapted for these reasons, all designed to provide a form of
          interactivity and entertainment tied to game design elements.
          There are a variety of differences in their designs and how they
          educate the user. These are broadly split between edutainment
          games that tend to focus on the entertainment value and rote
          learning but are unlikely to engage in critical thinking, and
          educational video games that are geared towards problem solving
          through motivation and positive reinforcement while downplaying
          the entertainment value.^[60] Examples of educational games
          include The Oregon Trail and the Carmen Sandiego series.
          Further, games not initially developed for educational purposes
          have found their way into the classroom after release, such as
--
          Minecraft,^[61] or offer critical thinking skills through puzzle
          video games like SpaceChem.^[62]

   Serious games
          [220px-AFA_Beech_in_Flight_Simulator.jpg] Microsoft Flight
          Simulator is an example of a simulation game. Further extending
          from educational games, serious games are those where the
          entertainment factor may be augmented, overshadowed, or even
          eliminated by other purposes for the game. Game design is used
          to reinforce the non-entertainment purpose of the game, such as
          using video game technology for the game's interactive world, or
          gamification for reinforcement training. Educational games are a
          form of serious games, but other types of games include fitness
          games that incorporate significant physical exercise to help
          keep the player fit (such as Wii Fit), simulator games that
          resemble fight simulators to pilot aircraft (such as Microsoft
          Flight Simulator), advergames that are built around the
          advertising of a product (such as Pepsiman), and newsgames aimed
          at conveying a specific advocacy message (such as
--

   Art games
          Although video games have been considered an art form on their
          own, games may be developed to try to purposely communicate a
          story or message, using the medium as a work of art. These art
          or arthouse games are designed to generate emotion and empathy
          from the player by challenging societal norms and offering
          critique through the interactivity of the video game medium.
          They may not have any type of win condition and are designed to
          let the player explore through the game world and scenarios.
          Most art games are indie games in nature, designed based on
          personal experiences or stories through a single developer or
          small team. Examples of art games include Passage, Flower, and
          That Dragon, Cancer.^[65]^[66]^[67]

   Main article: Video game content rating system

--

   Video games can be subject to national and international content rating
   requirements. Like with film content ratings, video game ratings typing
   identify the target age group that the national or regional ratings
   board believes is appropriate for the player, ranging from all-ages, to
   a teenager-or-older, to mature, to the infrequent adult-only games.
   Most content review is based on the level of violence, both in the type
--
   voluntary systems upheld by vendor practices, with penalty and fines
   issued by the ratings body on the video game publisher for misuse of
   the ratings. Among the major content rating systems include:
     * Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) that oversees games
       released in the United States. ESRB ratings are voluntary and rated
       along a E (Everyone), E10+ (Everyone 10 and older), T (Teen), M
       (Mature), and AO (Adults Only). Attempts to mandate video games
       ratings in the U.S. subsequently led to the landmark Supreme Court
       case, Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association in 2011 which
       ruled video games were a protected form of art, a key victory for
       the video game industry.^[68]
     * Pan European Game Information (PEGI) covering the United Kingdom,
       most of the European Union and other European countries, replacing
--
       and 18+.
     * Australian Classification Board (ACB) oversees the ratings of games
       and other works in Australia, using ratings of G (General), PG
--
       (Restricted), and X (Restricted for pornographic material). ACB can
       also deny to give a rating to game (RC – Refused Classification).
       The ACB's ratings are enforceable by law, and importantly, games
       cannot be imported or purchased digitally in Australia if they have
       failed to gain a rating or were given the RC rating, leading to a
       number of notable banned games.
     * Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO) rates games for
       Japan. Their ratings include A (all ages), B (12 and older), C (15

   Self-Regulation) would refuse to classify, and thus allow sale, of any
   game depicting Nazi imagery, and thus often requiring developers to
   replace such imagery with fictional ones. This ruling was relaxed in
   2018 to allow for such imagery for "social adequacy" purposes that
   applied to other works of art.^[69] China's video game segment is
   mostly isolated from the rest of the world due to the government's
   censorship, and all games published there must adhere to strict
   government review, disallowing content such as smearing the image of
   the Chinese Communist Party. Foreign games published in China often
   require modification by developers and publishers to meet these

   including sound designers, musicians, and other technicians; as well as

   Video games are programmed like any other piece of computer software.
   Prior to the mid-1970s, arcade and home consoles were programmed by
   assembling discrete electro-mechanical components on circuit boards,
   which limited games to relatively simple logic. By 1975, low-cost
   microprocessors were available at volume to be used for video game
   hardware, which allowed game developers to program more detailed games,
   widening the scope of what was possible.^[73]^[74] Ongoing improvements
   in computer hardware technology has expanded what has become possible
   to create in video games, coupled with convergence of common hardware
   between console, computer, and arcade platforms to simplify the
   development process.^[75] Today, game developers have a number of
   commercial and open source tools available for use to make games, often
   which are across multiple platforms to support portability, or may
   still opt to create their own for more specialized features and direct
   control of the game. Today, many games are built around a game engine
   that handles the bulk of the game's logic, gameplay, and rendering.
   These engines can be augmented with specialized engines for specific
--
   objects in real-time. A variety of middleware exists to help developers
   to access other features, such as for playback of videos within games,
   network-oriented code for games that communicate via online services,
   matchmaking for online games, and similar features. These features can
   be used from a developers' programming language of choice, or they may
   opt to also use game development kits that minimize the amount of
   direct programming they have to do but can also limit the amount of
   customization they can add into a game. Like all software, video games
   usually undergo quality testing before release to assure there are no
--
   talent, while publishers reduce costs to maintain profitability on
   their investment. Typically, a video game console development team
   ranges from 5 to 50 people, and some exceed 100. In May 2009,
--
   completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs
   has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines, rushed games and
   the release of unfinished products.^[77]

   While amateur and hobbyist game programming had existed since the late
   1970s with the introduction of home computers, a newer trend since the
   mid-2000s is indie game development. Indie games are made by small
   teams outside any direct publisher control, their games being smaller
   in scope than those from the larger "AAA" game studios, and are often
   experiment in gameplay and art style. Indie game development are aided
   by larger availability of digital distribution, including the newer

  Game theory and studies

--

   Main article: Game studies

   Although departments of computer science have been studying the
   technical aspects of video games for years, theories that examine games
   as an artistic medium are a relatively recent development in the
   humanities. The two most visible schools in this emerging field are
   ludology and narratology. Narrativists approach video games in the
   context of what Janet Murray calls "Cyberdrama". That is to say, their
   major concern is with video games as a storytelling medium, one that
   arises out of interactive fiction. Murray puts video games in the
   context of the Holodeck, a fictional piece of technology from Star
   Trek, arguing for the video game as a medium in which the player is
   allowed to become another person, and to act out in another world.^[79]
   This image of video games received early widespread popular support,
   and forms the basis of films such as Tron, eXistenZ and The Last
--
   Ludologists break sharply and radically from this idea. They argue that
   a video game is first and foremost a game, which must be understood in
   terms of its rules, interface, and the concept of play that it deploys.
   Espen J. Aarseth argues that, although games certainly have plots,
   characters, and aspects of traditional narratives, these aspects are
--
   widespread attention that narrativists have given to the heroine of the
   game Tomb Raider, saying that "the dimensions of Lara Croft's body,
   already analyzed to death by film theorists, are irrelevant to me as a
--
   theories of art because they claim that the artistic and socially
   relevant qualities of a video game are primarily determined by the
   underlying set of rules, demands, and expectations imposed on the
--

   While many games rely on emergent principles, video games commonly
   present simulated story worlds where emergent behavior occurs within
   the context of the game. The term "emergent narrative" has been used to
   describe how, in a simulated environment, storyline can be created
   simply by "what happens to the player."^[81] However, emergent behavior
   is not limited to sophisticated games. In general, any place where
   event-driven instructions occur for AI in a game, emergent behavior
   will exist. For instance, take a racing game in which cars are
   programmed to avoid crashing, and they encounter an obstacle in the
--
   of them and the obstacle. The programmer never wrote code to
   specifically create a traffic jam, yet one now exists in the game.

  Intellectual property for video games

   Main articles: Intellectual property protection of video games and
   Video game clone

   Most commonly, video games are protected by copyright, though both
   patents and trademarks have been used as well.
--
   Though local copyright regulations vary to the degree of protection,
   video games qualify as copyrighted visual-audio works, and enjoy
   cross-country protection under the Berne Convention.^[82] This
   typically only applies to the underlying code, as well as to the
   artistic aspects of the game such as its writing, art assets, and
   music. Gameplay itself is generally not considered copyrightable; in
   the United States among other countries, video games are considered to
   fall into the idea–expression distinction in that it is how the game is
   presented and expressed to the player that can be copyrighted, but not
   the underlying principles of the game.^[83]

   Because gameplay is normally ineligible for copyright, gameplay ideas
   in popular games are often replicated and built upon in other games. At
   times, this repurposing of gameplay can be seen as beneficial and a
--
   of others.^[84]^[85] For example Doom (1993) and Grand Theft Auto III
   (2001) introduced gameplay that created popular new game genres, the
   first-person shooter and the Grand Theft Auto clone, respectively, in
--
   frequently at the onset of the industry, developers would intentionally
   create video game clones of successful games and game hardware with few
   changes, which led to the flooded arcade and dedicated home console
--
   software systems.^[89] The industry remains challenged to distinguish
   between creating new games based on refinements of past successful
   games to create a new type of gameplay, and intentionally creating a
   clone of a game that may simply swap out art assets.^[90]

   The early history of the video game industry, following the first game
   hardware releases and through 1983, had little structure. Video games
   quickly took off during the golden age of arcade video games from the
   late 1970s to early 1980s, but the newfound industry was mainly
   composed of game developers with little business experience. This led
   to numerous companies forming simply to create clones of popular games
   to try to capitalize on the market.^[91] Due to loss of publishing
   control and oversaturation of the market, the North American home video
   game market crashed in 1983, dropping from revenues of around $3
   billion in 1983 to $100 million by 1985. Many of the North American
   companies created in the prior years closed down. Japan's growing game
   industry was briefly shocked by this crash but had sufficient longevity
--
   North America in 1985.^[91] Along with it, Nintendo established a
   number of core industrial practices to prevent unlicensed game
   development and control game distribution on their platform, methods
   that continue to be used by console manufacturers today.^[91]
--
   the 2000s, leading to the industry centralizing around low-risk,
   triple-A games and studios with large development budgets of at least
   $10 million or more.^[92] The advent of the Internet brought digital
   distribution as a viable means to distribute games, and contributed to
   the growth of more riskier, experimental independent game development
   as an alternative to triple-A games in the late 2000s and which has
   continued to grow as a significant portion of the video game
   industry.^[93]^[78]
--

   Video games have a large network effect that draw on many different
   sectors that tie into the larger video game industry. While video game
   developers are a significant portion of the industry, other key
   participants in the market include:^[94]
     * Publishers: Companies generally that oversee bringing the game from
       the developer to market. This often includes performing the
       marketing, public relations, and advertising of the game.
       Publishers frequently pay the developers ahead of time to make
       their games and will be involved in critical decisions about the
       direction of the game's progress, and then pay the developers
       additional royalties or bonuses based on sales performances. Other
       smaller, boutique publishers may simply offer to perform the
       publishing of a game for a small fee and a portion of the sales,
       and otherwise leave the developer with the creative freedom to
--
       between these points.
     * Distributors: Publishers often are able to produce their own game
       media and take the role of distributor, but there are also
       third-party distributors that can mass-produce game media and
       distribute to retailers. Digital storefronts like Steam and the iOS
--
       retailers, department and electronic stores, and specialty video
       game stores, sell games, consoles, and other accessories to
       consumers. This has also including a trade-in market in certain
       regions, allowing players to turn in used games for partial refunds
       or credit towards other games. However, with the uprising of
       digital marketplaces and e-commerce revolution, retailers have been
       performing worse than in the past.
     * Hardware manufacturers: The video game console manufacturers
       produce console hardware, often through a value chain system that
--
       typically require a license to develop for their platform and may
       control the production of some games, such as Nintendo does with
       the use of game cartridges for its systems. In exchange, the
       manufacturers may help promote games for their system and may seek
       console exclusivity for certain games. For games on personal
       computers, a number of manufacturers are devoted to
--
       cases and gear for handheld devices.
     * Journalism: While journalism around video games used to be
       primarily print-based, and focused more on post-release reviews and
       gameplay strategy, the Internet has brought a more proactive press
       that use web journalism, covering games in the months prior to
       release as well as beyond, helping to build excitement for games
       ahead of release.
     * Influencers: With the rising importance of social media, video game
       companies have found that the opinions of influencers using
       streaming media to play through their games has had a significant
       impact on game sales, and have turned to use influencers alongside
       traditional journalism as a means to build up attention to their
       game before release.
     * Esports: Esports is a major function of several multiplayer games
       with numerous professional leagues established since the 2000s,
--
     * Gamers: Proactive hobbyists who are players and consumers of video
       games. While their representation in the industry is primarily seen
       through game sales, many companies follow gamers' comments on
       social media or on user reviews and engage with them to work to
--
       men, the market shifted in the mid-2010s towards women and older
       players who generally preferred mobile and causal games, leading to
       further growth in those sectors.^[95]

   involved in hardware design or part of the production process, but
   digital distribution and indie game development of the late 2000s has
   allowed game developers to flourish nearly anywhere and diversify the

   [220px-Videogameretaildisplay.jpg] A retail display in Switzerland with

   According to the market research firm Newzoo, the global video game
   industry drew estimated revenues of over $159 billion in 2020. Mobile
   games accounted for the bulk of this, with a 48% share of the market,
   followed by console games at 28% and personal computer games at
   23%.^[1]

   Sales of different types of games vary widely between countries due to
   local preferences. Japanese consumers tend to purchase much more
   handheld games than console games and especially PC games, with a
   strong preference for games catering to local tastes.^[97]^[98] Another
   key difference is that, though having declined in the West, arcade
   games remain an important sector of the Japanese gaming industry.^[99]
   In South Korea, computer games are generally preferred over console
   games, especially MMORPG games and real-time strategy games. Computer
   games are also popular in China.^[100]

   Video Games exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2012

   Video game culture is a worldwide new media subculture formed around
   video games and game playing. As computer and video games have
   increased in popularity over time, they have had a significant
   influence on popular culture. Video game culture has also evolved over
   time hand in hand with internet culture as well as the increasing
   popularity of mobile games. Many people who play video games identify
   as gamers, which can mean anything from someone who enjoys games to
   someone who is passionate about it. As video games become more social
   with multiplayer and online capability, gamers find themselves in
--
   competition, as a new trend known as electronic sports is becoming more
   widely accepted. In the 2010s, video games and discussions of video
   game trends and topics can be seen in social media, politics,
   television, film and music. The COVID-19 pandemic during 2020–2021 gave
   further visibility to video games as a pastime to enjoy with friends
   and family online as a means of social distancing.^[101]^[102]

   Main article: Video games as an art form

   Since the mid-2000s there has been debate whether video games qualify
   as art, primarily as the form's interactivity interfered with the
--
   appeal. A significant debate on the matter came after film critic Roger
   Ebert published an essay "Video Games can never be art",^[103] which
   challenged the industry to prove him and other critics wrong.^[104] The
   view that video games were an art form was cemented in 2011 when the
   U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the landmark case Brown v. Entertainment
   Merchants Association that video games were a protected form of speech
   with artistic merit.^[105] Since then, video game developers have come
   to use the form more for artistic expression, including the development
   of art games,^[106] and the cultural heritage of video games as works
   of arts, beyond their technical capabilities, have been part of major
   museum exhibits, including The Art of Video Games at the Smithsonian
   American Art Museum and toured at other museums from 2012 to 2016.

   Main articles: Film adaptation § Video game adaptation, and Hollywood
   and the video game industry

   Video games will inspire sequels and other video games within the same
   franchise, but also have influenced works outside of the video game
   medium. Numerous television shows (both animated and live-action),
   films, comics and novels have been created based on existing video game
   franchises. Because video games are an interactive medium there has
   been trouble in converting them to these passive forms of media, and
   typically such works have been critically panned or treated as
   children's media. For example, until 2019, no video game film had ever
   been received a "Fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but the releases of
--
   "Fresh" ratings, shows signs of the film industry having found an
   approach to adapt video games for the large screen.^[107]^[108] That
   said, some early video game-based films have been highly successful at
   the box office, such as 1995's Mortal Kombat and 2001's Lara Croft:
--
   More recently since the 2000s, there has also become a larger
   appreciation of video game music, which ranges from chiptunes composed
   for limited sound-output devices on early computers and consoles, to
   fully-scored compositions for most modern games. Such music has
   frequently served as a platform for covers and remixes, and concerts
   featuring video game soundtracks performed by bands or orchestras, such
   as Video Games Live, have also become popular.^[109] Video games also
   frequently incorporate licensed music, particularly in the area of
   rhythm games, furthering the depth of which video games and music can
   work together.^[109]

   Further, video games can serve as a virtual environment under full
   control of a producer to create new works. With the capability to
   render 3D actors and settings in real-time, a new type of work
   machinima (short for "machine cinema") grew out from using video game
   engines to craft narratives.^[110] As video game engines gain higher
   fidelity, they have also become part of the tools used in more
--

   Separately, video games are also frequently used as part of the
   promotion and marketing for other media, such as for films, anime, and
   comics. However, these licensed games in the 1990s and 2000s often had
   a reputation for poor quality, developed without any input from the
   intellectual property rights owners, and several of them are considered
   among lists of games with notably negative reception, such as Superman
   64. More recently, with these licensed games being developed by
   triple-A studios or through studios directly connected to the licensed
   property owner, there has been a significant improvement in the quality
   of these games, with an early trendsetting example of Batman: Arkham
   Asylum.^[112]

   Main articles: Video games in education and Video game behavioral
   effects

   Besides their entertainment value, appropriately-designed video games
   have been seen to provide value in education across several ages and
   comprehension levels. Learning principles found in video games have
   been identified as possible techniques with which to reform the U.S.
--
   benefits.^[114]^[dubious – discuss] Students are found to be "learning
   by doing" while playing video games while fostering creative
   thinking.^[115]

   Video games are also believed to be beneficial to the mind and body. It
   has been shown that action video game players have better hand–eye
   coordination and visuo-motor skills, such as their resistance to
--
   nonplayers.^[116] Researchers found that such enhanced abilities could
   be acquired by training with action games, involving challenges that
   switch attention between different locations, but not with games
   requiring concentration on single objects.^[citation needed] A 2018
--
   population, especially with young adults.^[117] A 2019 systematic
   review also added support for the claim that video games are beneficial
   to the brain, although the beneficial effects of video gaming on the
   brain differed by video games types.^[118]

   Organisers of video gaming events, such as the organisers of the D-Lux
   video game festival in Dumfries, Scotland, have emphasised the positive
   aspects video games can have on mental health. Organisers, mental
   health workers and mental health nurses at the event emphasised the
   relationships and friendships that can be built around video games and
   how playing games can help people learn about others as a precursor to
   discussing the person's mental health.^[119] A study in 2020 from
   Oxford University also suggested that playing video games can be a
   benefit to a person's mental health. The report of 3,274 gamers, all
   over the age of 18, focused on the games Animal Crossing: New Horizons
   and Plants vs Zombies: Battle for Neighborville and used actual
   play-time data. The report found that those that played more games
   tended to report greater "wellbeing".^[120]^[121] Also in 2020,
   computer science professor Regan Mandryk of the University of
   Saskatchewan said her research also showed that video games can have
   health benefits such as reducing stress and improving mental health.

   Main article: Video game controversies

   [220px-Compulsion_loop_for_video_games.svg.png] The compulsion loop for
   video games is believed to trigger dopamine release that can encourage
   addictive behavior.

   Video games have caused controversy since the 1970s.^[124] Parents and
   children's advocates regularly raise concerns that violent video games
   can influence young players into performing those violent acts in real
   life, and events such as the Columbine High School massacre in 1999 in
   which the perpetrators specifically alluded to using video games to
   plot out their attack, raised further fears.^[citation needed] Medical
   experts and mental health professionals have also raised concerned that
   video games may be addictive, and the World Health Organization has
   included "gaming disorder" in the 11th revision of its International
--
   the American Psychiatric Association, have stated that there is
   insufficient evidence that video games can create violent tendencies or
   lead to addictive behavior,^[125] though agree that video games
   typically use a compulsion loop in their core design that can create
--
   behavior.^[126]^[127]^[128] Even with case law establishing that video
   games qualify as a protected art form, there has been pressure on the
   video game industry to keep their products in check to avoid
   over-excessive violence particularly for games aimed at younger
   children. The potential addictive behavior around games, coupled with
   increased used of post-sale monetization of video games, has also
   raised concern among parents, advocates, and government officials about
   gambling tendencies that may come from video games, such as controversy
   around the use of loot boxes in many high-profile games.

   Numerous other controversies around video games and its industry have
   arisen over the years, among the more notable incidents include the
   1993 United States Congressional hearings on violent games like Mortal
   Kombat which lead to the formation of the ESRB ratings system, numerous
   legal actions taken by attorney Jack Thompson over violent games such
   as Grand Theft Auto III and Manhunt from 2003 to 2007, the outrage over
--
   racial, and LGBTQ+ discrimination and mischaracterization of these
   minority groups in video games. A further issue in the industry is
   related to working conditions, as development studios and publishers
   frequently use "crunch time", required extended working hours, in the
   weeks and months ahead of a game's release to assure on-time delivery.

   Main articles: Video game collecting and Video game preservation

   See also: List of video game museums

   Players of video games often maintain collections of games. More
   recently there has been interest in retrogaming, focusing on games from
   the first decades. Games in retail packaging in good shape have become
   collectors items for the early days of the industry, with some rare
--
   Separately, there is also concern about the preservation of video
   games, as both game media and the hardware to play them degrade over
   time. Further, many of the game developers and publishers from the
   first decades no longer exist, so records of their games have
   disappeared. Archivists and preservations have worked within the scope
   of copyright law to save these games as part of the cultural history of
   the industry.

   There are many video game museums around the world, including the
   National Videogame Museum in Frisco, Texas,^[129] which serves as the
   largest museum wholly dedicated to the display and preservation of the
   industry's most important artifacts.^[130] Europe hosts video game
   museums such as the Computer Games Museum in Berlin^[131] and the
   Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines in Moscow and
   Saint-Petersburg.^[132]^[133] The Museum of Art and Digital
   Entertainment in Oakland, California is a dedicated video game museum
   focusing on playable exhibits of console and computer games.^[134] The
   Video Game Museum of Rome is also dedicated to preserving video games
   and their history.^[135] The International Center for the History of
   Electronic Games at The Strong in Rochester, New York contains one of
   the largest collections of electronic games and game-related historical
   materials in the world, including a 5,000-square-foot (460 m^2) exhibit
   which allows guests to play their way through the history of video
   games.^[136]^[137]^[138] The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC
   has three video games on permanent display: Pac-Man, Dragon's Lair, and
   Pong.^[139]

   The Museum of Modern Art has added a total of 20 video games and one
   video game console to its permanent Architecture and Design Collection
   since 2012.^[140]^[141] In 2012, the Smithsonian American Art Museum
   ran an exhibition on "The Art of Video Games".^[142] However, the
   reviews of the exhibit were mixed, including questioning whether video
   games belong in an art museum.^[143]^[144]

   Eight examples that explain all you need to know about serious games
   and game-based learning

Eight examples that explain all you need to know about serious games and
game-based learning

--

   At first sight, putting words like “serious” and “game” together might
   seem impossible, but it’s not. In recent years, serious games have
   proven that it is possible to learn while you play. This teaching
   method is known as game-based learning, a trend that’s expanding at the
   speed of light in primary schools, prestigious universities and large
   corporations. In this post, we’re going to tell you all you need to
   know about serious games and learning through video games, including
   their main characteristics and benefits, and a few prime examples.

What is a serious game?

   Serious games are games whose primary objective is NOT fun or
   entertainment, rather learning or practicing a skill. Its use has
--

   In the field of education, one of the most simple (and effective) games
   is Dragon Box Elements. Here, players have to build an army, defeat the
--
   geometry and the theorems of Euclid himself. Dragon Box is a good
   example of a serious game: the students learn math while they have fun
   with a video game.

--

What is game-based learning?

   The method that uses video games for learning purposes is known as
   game-based learning. The key lies in the fact that the content and the
   skills that you want to teach are not put across in a face-to-face
   class or in a book but rather through video games. Advocates of this
   innovative method of teaching think that video games can be a fun and
   effective tool at one and the same time, reducing the costs of training
   programs, increasing student motivation and facilitating direct
   practice. The star products of game-based learning are precisely,
   serious games.

   method of teaching. The expert in nursing, Claudia Johnston, based
   herself on first-person shooting video games (such as Quake or Duke to
   develop Pulse!!, which reproduces the conditions of an emergency ward
   in a hospital. Thanks to this video game, future nurses can practice
   all they have learnt in their theoretical classes and gain experience

The 5 elements of a serious game

   It’s no easy task to create a serious game: it requires a lot of
   talent, a lot of time and a lot of money. Although there is a huge
   variety of formats and objectives, most game-based learning systems
   tend to have five elements that ensure they work properly and are
--

   1 – A story. Although it is by no means essential, most video games
   have a plot or a main story. It may be a prince risking life and limb
--
   characters), the easier it will be to motivate the players and for them
   to get into the game.

--

   The video game Pacific starts just there, with a story: while on a
   humanitarian mission, a team’s plane crashes and they are trapped on an
--

   2 – Gamification. The second fundamental element of any serious game
   are the game dynamics, which include the rankings, rewards, badges or
   points systems. This gamification tends to animate and motivate the
--
   through to the next level (remember Mario Bros?). Classifications or
   rankings are also very important in serious games: healthy competition
   with our classmates or work colleagues encourage us to try that bit
--
   friends and relations. Each lesson they learn has a reward. Even though
   Duolingo is not strictly speaking a serious game, it is one of the most
   successful applications when it comes to using gamification elements
--
   courses (normally with dozens of people in the classroom and one single
   teacher), serious games offer immediate and personalized feedback. The
   player interacts directly with the game and instantly receives a reward
   or a punishment. In the most sophisticated video games, this feedback
   is also detailed and argued: users can know where they have gone wrong
--

   4 – Simulation. In most cases, serious games reproduce or imitate real
   life situations. Using fictitious characters and by recreating
--
   new reality and to practice the skills and concepts they have acquired
   during the game.

--
   Department, probably the public body which has dedicated most money and
   resources to game-based learning in the last number of decades. One of
   its best-known video games is The Virtual Interactive Combat
   Environment (VICE), which uses a sophisticated 3D simulator to allow
--
   5 – The goal: to learn. We’ll not tire of repeating it: the key element
   of serious games is that their purpose is to teach something. All the
   elements we’ve mentioned above can be found in endless commercial video
   games, but that does not necessarily make them serious games. As well
   as using all these elements, serious games also have to have a purpose
   that is not recreational and that almost always has to do with a
--

What are the advantages of game-based learning and serious games?

--

   Serious games and game-based learning are two of the best solutions to
   this problem. Video games are necessarily interactive and users have to
   make decisions from the word go. Game dynamics encourage effort and the
   narrative they are wrapped up in serves to motivate the students. The
   most sophisticated video games can even turn learning into an
   addiction. As they explain in the book The Gamification of Learning and
--
   it can prove hardest to achieve engagement. To solve that problem, in
   Jordan they have developed a video game on Facebook called “Our City”,
   which seeks to get people between 15 and 24 involved in their local
   communities, enhance their social behavior and invite them to take part
   in the life of the city. The game, which has certain similarities with
   the popular The Sims, makes young people mayors, and it allows them to
--
   term, and it prevents us from reflecting in any profound way on the
   challenges and opportunities we are facing. Serious games, thanks to
   how they can immerse us in other worlds and whisk us away from reality,
--

   As opposed to face-to-face training, game-based learning is a form of
   learning that is based on practice. Thanks to the simulators, the
   players can interact with other characters and they can use the
   knowledge they have gained from the outset. Serious games also offer
   the best of both worlds: on the one hand, the simulators should
   reproduce reality as faithfully as possible; on the other hand, the
   fact that it is a video game allows users to practice in safety without
   any risk of personal harm or material damage. This is particularly
--
   Real and direct practice is also vital in the corporate world. As is
   the case with the video game Merchants (part of the Gamelearn
   platform), which trains employees in any manner of company in how to
--
   to endeavor to build their commercial empire and to face up to tough
   negotiators such as Machiavelli. This video game allows the employees
   of a multinational to handle difficult negotiations that they can then
--

   One of the advantages of serious games is that by increasing the
   engagement and the motivation of the students, they also increase their
--
   That may well sound overly ambitious, but the fact is that several
   serious games have also been so bold as to attempt to change the world.
   The fact that we like gamification and simulators can be a good tool
--
   spreading civic values. As opposed to the stereotype by which video
   games are a cause of antisocial or violent behavior, the reality is
   that game-based learning can encourage prosocial and positive attitudes
   for society as a whole.
--

   In 2005, the United Nations World Food Programme developed a video game
   to promote social awareness and the fight against hunger. In the video
   game (Food Force) the players put themselves in the shoes of a UN
   rookie, who has to handle a crisis involving famine and civil war on an
--
   the populace and to help the country to become self-sufficient in the
   medium to long term. A fantastic example of how serious games can make
   the world a better place.
--

The success of serious games and game-based learning

   All these benefits have placed game-based learning at the vanguard of
   the revolution in education that the world of teaching and corporative
   training is experiencing at the moment. Many of these more or less
   sophisticated video games are used every day by millions of people (in
   many cases, without their even realizing it). For example, in the
   United Kingdom, most players (33%) prefer video games to puzzles, word
   games or trivial pursuits. Although not all of them can be considered
   serious games, it is a good indicator of the growing acceptance of
   game-based learning throughout the world.

   last year the business will have reached 5.449 billion dollars. There

   facilitate the memorization and retention of knowledge. While serious
   games have been around for centuries (let’s not forget that ever since
   we were small we’ve all been learning as we play), the social and

   to the four corners of the planet. Whether it is to improve the

Why We Play Boardgames

   My husband and I have spent the last ten years playing board games
   together. No, I’m not talking about seeing if we need anger management

   movie or going to college parties, we spent the majority of our time
   together learning card games, and teaching each other our family
   favorites. When we tired of Canasta and Sequence, we began looking for

   have dove head first into the deep end where our hobby has grown into
   shelves full of games that have brought us, our family, and our friends
   closer together through hours spent laughing, playing, and enjoying
   each others company over the many different games brought to the table.

--
   important part of our family for us and our four kids. We think that
   every family can benefit by incorporating board games into their lives.
   Yes, I know that may sound a bit nerdy, but here us out.
--
   together and bond; no places to be except home with each other. We use
   this time to play games with our kids. Now, our kids are young, so it’s
   not always as idyllic as we go into it hoping it will be. But what we

   together and finding joy in simple fun, whether that comes from a board
   game or not.

   Games also allow us to have great date nights at home. Finding a sitter
   for four kids 6 and under can be hard, and after paying for the sitter,

   one another. We’ll put the kids to bed, come downstairs, and for a few
   hours we’ll take time to play a game. Maybe we’ll even spend what we
   would have spent on a date and get a new game to enjoy; when it comes
   to bang for your buck, you can’t beat buying a board game that you will
   be able to enjoy a countless number of times rather than just once.

   more and more ways to unplug. When we spend a night engaged in a board
   game, we walk away with memories, laughs, and a fun experience that can
   only come from face-to-face social interaction. Board games are
   incredibly versatile; you can take them with you to play indoors or

   You’d be surprised by the level of mental engagement required to play
   modern board games. In games like Candyland, the winner is already
   determined before the first card has even been flipped – there is
   nothing you can do. But in today’s board games you have a variety of
   styles, from puzzles to tactical area control games to keep you and
   your brain sharp and always thinking. The challenges provided by
   physical board games are better than anything you’ll find in some app,
   even apps of the board games you might be playing.

   this really has developed into a passion for us. We board game for many
   reasons, more than even listed above, but the main reason is, without a

   friends. We love being able to gather round a table, phones aside, and
   spend time connecting with people, old friends and new. The board game
   is really just a vehicle for us to bring people together and enjoy each
   others company. Over the last ten years we’ve had our fair share of
   friends and family that have told us that they “don’t like board games”
   and time and time again, we’ve found that there truly is something for

   You don’t have to like every game, we certainly don’t, but the
   diversity offered by today’s games is simply incredible and if you’ve
   made it this far down this post and are wondering where to start, then

   who will let us and especially our kids who have no choice! So without
   further ado, here are some board game ideas to get you started!

   This game has really broken through the hobby wall and has become much
   more mainstream over the years, you may have even seen it in your local
   Target. This game is simple to learn, but far more layered in its
   tactical strategy. Players collect cards of various types of train cars

   balance greed as you take on more routes to earn more points, and fear
--

   This game has a multitude of expansions offering different train maps
   featuring different countries and states, but we recommend the original
   game with the North American map to start and it is great for the whole
   family starting at about age 8.
--
   More of a cooperative player? Great! You might love Pandemic! In this
   game several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all
   across the globe and it is your mission to fight these while

   This game is incredibly fun and endlessly re-playable. Start at a
   beginners difficulty level, once you’ve mastered that, work your way up
--

   If you know how to play Yahtzee you can play this game, promise! King
   of Tokyo is a hit with everyone as players take on the role of mutant
--
   gamers as young as 6, but don’t let that deter you, this is far from a
   kid game and will offer tons of fun for teens and adult gamers as
   well.
--

   Survive is a simple, yet cutthroat game where players try to evacuate
   their pieces from an island that is breaking up while remembering where
--
   sabotage each other’s escape plans so you can stand victorious with the
   most points on shore before the island blows up. This game plays up to
   four and works well for ages 6 and above.

A Brief History of Games

--

   Human history and games are inextricably intertwined. Irrefutable
   evidence resounds down through the ages that fun and games are not
   frivolous pursuits per se—instead, they come naturally to us as
   essential parts of being alive. When you understand the evolution of
   games, you can begin to make intelligent choices about what elements of
   games you might want to include in your gamification designs.

--
   beings are just better evolved monkeys, it’s likely that we’ve been
   playing games for a long, long time. We were probably playing games
   before we learned to speak or even to stand on two legs.

   That means we have no idea what the first games we played were like.
   However, we do have a good idea of the timeline of modern game
   development.
--
   Southeastern Iran, archeologists discovered a 3,000-year-old set of
   dice! We don’t know exactly what games those early Persians would have
   played with them, but the popularity of dice has endured throughout the
--

   Dice games have been with mankind for a very long time, as you can see
   from this cave painting.
--

   In 14th-century England, people were playing a game called Hazard (it’s
   mentioned in that famous work The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey
--
   It had a very complex rule set and has since been supplanted by dice
   games with simpler rules.

--
   cube with dots and nothing more—as an effective, if chancy, determinant
   is ageless. You may not know this, but the most popular game in casinos
   would remain—well into the 21st century—a dice game. Craps is the only
   game in a gambling house where the odds are in favour of the gambler.
   Despite this, it’s the most profitable game for the casinos; people
   don’t seem to know just when to stop playing. And play they
--

   There are references to tile games in China that are over 2,900 years
   old. Dominoes emerged 1,000 years later during the Song Dynasty (also
   in China). However, Western dominoes probably only began in the 18th
   century, and Mahjong (the most popular tile game in the world – it’s of
   Chinese origin) didn’t arrive until the 19th century.

Board Games are Even Older

   If you enjoy a game of Monopoly or Scrabble, it would appear that you
   are in good company. The earliest known board games are 5,000 years old
   and were played by the Egyptians. We don’t know the rules of these
   games, but there is a “Senet” board that dates back to about 3500 B.C.!

   The Chinese invented their first known board game in 200 B.C., and, in
   Western Europe, they were playing Tafl (a game very similar to chess)
   from 400 B.C.

   Chess is often considered to be the “archetypal” board game and is
   itself very old, but there were board games well prior to the invention
   of chess.
--
   If you’ve ever played Go, Chess, Backgammon or Nine Men’s Morris, then
   you’ve played a game with more than a thousand years of history! Go is
   from 200 B.C. in Korea, Backgammon from Iran around 600 A.D. (complete
--

   Snakes and Ladders, one of the world’s most popular children’s games
   probably began in India in the 16th century. And, surprise, surprise,
   dice power the probability for players in that game, too.

   The first commercial board game arrived in the year 1800 and was
   produced by George Fox in England. It was called the Mansion of
   Happiness and was essentially a “race game” similar to Ludo. The oldest
   surviving board game company is Milton Bradley (whose famous games
   include; Downfall, Hungry Hippos and Connect 4), who were formed in
--

   The Mansion of Happiness was the very first board game to be produced
   commercially (i.e., on an industrial basis).
--

   Card games are a more recent invention, and the first use of a card
   deck was probably in Ancient China. They would have been played during
--
   The four-suit (hearts, spades, clubs and diamonds) deck that we’re most
   familiar with was invented in France around 1480. The oldest card game
   that we still play is probably Cribbage, which came from the 17th
--

   In the 1990s, cards were revisited and games like ‘Magic! The
   Gathering’ were introduced and became incredibly popular. Card games
   would also extend to trumps—a classic favourite in British schools,
--

Table Games

   Carom, is possibly the oldest table game (it’s very similar to
   tiddlywinks or shuffleboard), but no-one knows exactly when or where it
--

   The game pictured above, may look (at first glance) like pool, but it’s
   actually a modern billiards table—as you can see by the lack of pockets
--

   As you can see, games have a long rich history, and whenever you decide
   to play a game, you’re in good company. Human beings have been playing
   games throughout the centuries. They are part of the human experience.

What about Electronic Games?

   You may be surprised to find that the first electronic game was
   invented in the United States before the computer! A patent was filed
--
   also in the United States, (very few) people began playing computer
   games on mainframe systems – these would have been out of reach for the
   vast majority of people as the hardware would have been astronomically
--

   The first games console was the Magnavox Odyssey – released in 1972.
   Arcade games such as Space Invaders, Pacman, etc. began life in 1978
   and became hugely popular into the early 1980s. During that time, quite
--
   industry killed off most of the companies involved in 1983. When the
   Japanese picked up the reins and began developing video games, console
   gaming became universally popular, signalling the slow downfall of the
   arcade game.

     “Everyone has played video games at some point these days, and video
     games are fun.”
     —PewDiePie, Swedish comedian and web producer

   Games have a long history, as you can see, and the electronic game’s
   roots stretch right back to the earliest of human games. It’s not that
   our ancestors needed to tell us that games go with the territory of
   being alive; games are hardwired into our DNA.

--

   Human history and games are inextricably intertwined. For millennia,

   which have been played for generations, and some are new for this

   There are some games kids often play on playground equipment, whether
   it’s making believe they’re in a castle or mountain climbing. Kids have
   such active imaginations, though, that they can play games even when
   there’s nothing but asphalt, blacktop or a sidewalk to play on.

   Academic studies are certainly important, but playing games at school
   is just as helpful for growth and learning. Games help kids stay in
   shape, develop their creative abilities and build social skills — what

Top Games To Play On A School Playground For Kids in the United States

   It would be impossible to list all the different types of children’s
   playground games, especially when you consider all the children’s games
   worldwide. The following list, however, includes many simple and
   classic outdoor playground games that children have played in
   schoolyards for generations:
--

   Dodge Ball is a great game to get students active. Two evenly-numbered
   teams line up their dodgeballs in the middle of a court and retreat to
   each end. On the signal, they rush to the center to grab a ball and
   throw it at opposing players, eliminating them from the game. The team
   that eliminates all players from the other team wins the game.

--

   A popular jump rope game, Double Dutch, requires at least three people.
   Two players swing jump ropes in opposite directions, while the third
   player jumps between them without disrupting them. Players often chant
   or sing a rhyme to help time the jumps. This is a great game to teach
   kids to coordinate with others.

   Heads Up Seven Up is a classic classroom game in which seven “choosers”
   make their way around a group of players who have their heads down and

   giving a description of the item like its color. Players take turns
   guessing what the item is. Use this game to help students develop their
   investigative skills.

   potato on the playground with a ball or soft object. Students stand in
   a circle and pass the ball. If they drop it, they are out. The game
   continues until there is only one player standing.

   Games that rely on children’s brains and encourage teamwork are equally
   beneficial because they help to strengthen mental and social
   skills that will come in handy as they enter middle school, high
   school, college and the job market. The games that kids play on the
   school and park playground offer many benefits, whether they’re
   creative games that use their imagination or active games that work out
   their body. Children should be encouraged to play these simple
   playground games as much as possible.

   Although there are many opportunities for hunting small game in
   Washington, small game hunting is not nearly as popular as big game
   hunting. Often, hunters pursue small game while they are hunting other

   and hares, foxes, and coyotes. Small game animals are found in all
   areas that offer suitable habitats. Hunting methods and techniques

   discussing the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down California’s law
   barring the sale or rental of violent video games to people under 18.
   The author, Dr. Cheryl Olson,   describes how the proposed law was
   based on the erroneous assumption that such games influence violent
   behavior in real life.
--
   Dr. Olson suggests that the deliberately outrageous nature of violent
   games, though disturbing, makes them easily discernible from real life
   and suggests that the interactivity could potentially make such games
   less harmful.

   youth violence has declined over the last several years while violent
   video game playing has increased significantly during the same period.

   third variable that explains the relationship between two other
   variables—may explain the negative correlation of video game playing
   and violent behavior. As one example, socioeconomic status may explain
   both a decline in violent behavior and an increase in video game
   playing. More affluent youth have the means and time to buy and play
   video games, which keeps them safely inside while avoiding potentially
   violent interactions on the street.  Dr. Olsen also cites several
   studies that have failed to show a connection between violent video

Studies support a link between violent video games and aggressive behavior

     * In their book, Violent Video Game Effects on Children and

            were randomly assigned to play either a violent or nonviolent

            behavior; habitual video game, television, and move habits,
            and several other control variables.  The authors reported
            three main findings: 1) participants who played one of violent
            video games would choose to punish their opponents with
            significantly more high-noise blasts than those who played the
            nonviolent games; 2) habitual exposure to violent media was

Violent video games may increase precursors to violent behavior, such as
bullying

   Although playing violent video games may not necessarily determine
   violent or aggressive behavior, it may increase precursors to violent
   behavior.  In fact, Dr. Olson points out that violent video games may
   be related to bullying, which researchers have found to be a risk
   factor for more serious violent behavior. Therefore, video game playing
   may have an indirect effect on violent behavior by increasing risk
   factors for it.  Doug Gentile notes that the only way for violent video
   games to affect serious criminal violence statistics is if they were
   the primary predictor of crime, which they may not be.  Rather, they

Should video games be regulated?

   factor for negative health outcomes.  Huesmann argues the same analysis
   could be applied to video game exposure.  Although exposure to violent
   video games is not the sole factor contributing to aggression and
   violence among children and adolescents, it is a contributing risk
--
   but does not necessarily result in violent children. Likewise,
   researchers have found that first person killing video game playing is
   associated with increased risk for violent behavior, but not all the
   time. Yet, constant exposure to violence from multiple sources,
   including first person violent video games, in the absence of positive
   factors that help to buffer these negative exposures is likely to

   Despite disagreements on the exact nature of the relationship between
   violent video game playing and violent or aggressive behavior,
   significant evidence exists linking video game playing with violent
   behavior and its correlates.  Although we are somewhat agnostic about
   the role of social controls like laws banning the sale of violent video
   games to minors, an argument against such social controls based on the
   conclusion  that the video games have no effect seems to oversimplify

Board game types explained: a beginner's guide to tabletop gaming terms

   How to tell your roll-and-writes from your roll-and-moves.
   Settlers of Catan board game gameplay
   Simon Castle avatar
--
   Getting into tabletop gaming as a beginner can be a challenge. From
   knowing the best board games, working out what to buy first and finding
   others interested in playing them with you, through to understanding
--
   most welcoming activities around. You can start anywhere and with
   anyone - you can learn how to play D&ampD in a board games shop or café,
   crack out a party board game down the pub, learn how to play Magic: The
   Gathering with an established club, or simply enjoy playing around the
   kitchen table with your friends or even all by yourself thanks to the
   growing number of solo games.

   But like everything that a lot of people spend a lot of time on, a
   whole specialist language has built up around board games, not least of
   which is the various genres that tabletop games get grouped into.
   What’s a deckbuilder compared to a deck construction game? What makes a
   living card game different to a trading card game, and is that the same
   as an expandable deck game? What do you actually do in a
   worker-placement board game?

--
   put together the following beginner’s guide to the different types of
   board game types and what they mean.

   Bear in mind that many of these board game types aren’t exhaustive or
   exclusive, and many board games will fall into more than one of these
   categories - or might be something else entirely. However, the
   following board game terms represent the most common types of games on
   the tabletop, so they’re a good place to start next time you’re
   wondering if something really is a Eurogame, or just happens to have a
   farmer on the cover.

   Board games with no theme at all, or what theme is offered is so
   disconnected from the actual experience of playing that it might as

   Board games with some form of map or board defining a space that
   players compete to dominate, usually through adding their own pieces to

   Campaign board games are defined by individual plays following a series
   of connected scenarios, where the actions and outcome of one scenario
   will usually affect the next. Legacy board games are a specific type of
   campaign game where your choices and actions cause you to make
   permanent (often physical) changes to the game and its components, such
   as applying stickers to the board or tearing up cards, often providing

   less powerful ones removed. Deckbuilders are sometimes conflated with
   deck construction games such as trading card games, with the difference
   being that in deckbuilders the act of creating and customising your

   A type of board game where the players use different decks of cards to
   play, constructed prior to the game from a large pool of options,
   according to specific rules. There are two main distribution models:
   trading or collectible card games sell booster pack products with a
   randomised set of cards in each, while living card games and expandable
   deck games provide a fixed set of cards in each expansion. (Living card
   game applies specifically to such games produced by Fantasy Flight
   Games, which has trademarked the term.)

   Examples: Magic: The Gathering, Android: Netrunner, Marvel Champions,
   Arkham Horror: The Card Game.

   Board games involving physical skill, whether using the whole body as
   in Twister or just the fingers for moving things about, as with
   removing blocks in Jenga. This can include flicking discs or other
   objects with your fingers like Flick ‘em Up, balancing things in games
   such as Beasts of Balance or even throwing objects around, like Dungeon

Eurogame

   Often shortened to just ‘Euro’, these are strategy-focused board games
   that prioritise limited-randomness over theme. Usually competitive with
   interaction between players through passive competition rather than
   aggressive conflict. Named for the fact many of the early games of this
   style were developed in Europe - particularly Germany - in contrast to
   the more thematic but chance-driven “American-style” games of the time.
   (Sometimes referred to as 'Ameritrash' by those who dislike the high

   Examples: Agricola, Paladins of the West Kingdom.

   Quedlinburg - a game in which pushing your luck leads to victory (or
   everything blowing up in your face).

   Board games that invite you to take ever bigger risks to achieve
   increasingly valuable rewards - or to decide to keep what you’ve got
   before you lose everything. Think the card game blackjack or deciding
   whether to give an uncertain answer on Who Wants to be a Millionaire?

   Board games where you roll one or more dice and move that many spaces -

   of the game, so even in games where everyone uses the same dice,
   slightly different choices at the start can lead to very different end
   results. Some games twist the name by replacing the dice with something
   like cards for a ‘flip-and-write’ (Welcome To…) or the writing with

   Board games with a focus on narrative and description that is directed
   or fully created by the players. This could be an overarching story

   Board games where you choose actions from spaces on the board by

   Board games are a great way to break the ice, whether you’re at a party
   or hosting a get-together with folks you haven’t seen in a while. But
   with so many options available — from strategy board games to social
   ones that require singing or drawing — it can be hard to find the right
   one for you and your friends. So while we’ve written about board games
   before — including the best two-player board games, best family board
   games, and best board games for kids — here, I’ve rounded up the 24
   best board games for adults, according to fellow Strategist staffers,
   contributors, and a variety of people who play them all the time.

   they are “full of inside-joke possibilities and they let you make new

   “The premise of Saboteur, an inexpensive, whimsically mining-themed
   game designed by Frederic Moyersoen and produced by German games
   company Amigo, is relatively simple: Players work toward a shared goal,
--
   the majority, the miners,” explains Strategist writer Erin Schwartz,
   who compares it to similar games like Mafia and Among Us. “Although
   Saboteur is a tabletop game, the basic unit of play is the same, which
   is talking to your friends to figure out who’s working against the
   group.” While the game can be played with as few as three, Schwartz
   finds its best for larger groups of five or more players, to keep
   things interesting. The game scales well to groups of different skill
   level and competitiveness, they add. “But with a group of seasoned

   Strategist senior writer Liza Corsillo discovered this game by way of
   her “strategy-game connoisseur” brother and it quickly became a family
   game-night staple. According to Corsillo, Raccoon Tycoon combines the
   fast play of Ticket to Ride with the social interaction of Settlers of
   Catan, “but is more engaging and fun to look at.” Like Ticket to Ride,
   a player will win the game by collecting the most points, “but there
   are multiple ways to earn them — amassing wealth and owning railroads,

   Digital Games at Teachers College, Columbia University, asks about the
   basic premise of this spy-themed Czech favorite. Similar to the basic

Best drawing-focused board game for adults

   “This is my favorite party game when mixing kids and adults,” says
   Scott Cooper, owner of Seattle-based Blue Highway Games. A cross
   between Pictionary and telephone, each player attempts to draw the
--
   their guess — which ideally matches the previous player’s word — to the
   next player, who is then tasked with drawing it. The game is finished
   once all of the boards have been returned to their original player.
   According to Dr. Michael James Heron of Meeple Like Us, a
   board-game-review site with a focus on accessibility, “It plays really
   quickly, has everyone laughing all of the time, and likely won’t

   Strategist writer Lauren Ro, who admits she finds most board games

   players draw blindly from their ingredient bags,” he says. Some

Best beginner campaign-style game for adults

--

   “Charterstone is a campaign-style game in which, over the course of 12
   games, you’ll build and expand a village shared by you and your
   opponents by constructing buildings and unlocking new elements with
   each play,” says Demers. “Consider it the board-game equivalent of a
   Netflix binge,” she adds, because you won’t be able to stop playing the
   game once you start. The branching storyline slowly grows more
   complicated, and by the end, after you’ve completed your 12-game
   campaign, “you will have a unique-to-you board game you can play again
   and again.”

   Patchwork, created by accomplished game designer Uwe Rosenberg, is one
   of the best two-player games for beginners. The game challenges players
   to strategically collect different pieces to create a quilt. May calls
   it “the perfect game for couples” that is sure to delight “fans of
   Blokus or Tetris.” Cooper adds that although the rules are simple to
   understand and it only takes about 15 minutes to play, the “subtle
   strategy keeps it interesting.” May agrees: “Games are usually quite

   “a great game to get lost in with a buddy.” It blends together a
   traditional card game with role-playing elements as players take on the
   roles of two investigators — each with their own set of strengths and
   weaknesses — who attempt to solve the game’s mysteries. “This

The Importance of Rules in Games

--

   Rules, rules, rules! A game is only as good as its rules, and how well
   we play the game is defined by how well we follow the rules. What is so
   fascinating about many of the games we play today is that there are
   often no instruction books included—yet we somehow know how to play
--
   In this article, we will take a look at why rules are important and how
   they can make playing games more enjoyable. It doesn't matter if you
   follow the rules that the game came with or if you make up your own
   rules; it really just matters that everyone agrees on what the rules
--
   good winner and a good loser, and how you can settle arguments that
   arise in the course of playing your game. By being clear on the rules
   of the game, you're sure to maximize your fun at all times!

--

   When I was a kid, we used to play a schoolyard game called
   Champ—otherwise known as Four Square. It was played in one large
--
   One person is the “Champ” and stands in the Champ's square. How you
   determine who becomes the Champ for the first game is up to the
   players. Here's some ideas for choosing a champ: You can flip a coin,
   pull straws, pick a number from one to ten and have the players guess
   it, or go alphabetically by first initial of first name. In our games,
   the Champ was the Champ until beaten by another player.
--
   someone else takes your place in the square. The object is to get the
   Champ knocked out of the game, so you can move into the Champ's square.
   The Champ always goes first and has certain advantages over the other
--

   The most interesting thing that I remember about this game is that
   there was always at least one kid who knew the rules—and we made up
--
   were passed on to the next group of kids. The rules were always
   announced at the beginning of recess and the game went on through
   recess. Sometimes we'd pick up where we left off the day before—we'd
--

   When you decide to play any game, it's important to establish the rules
   in advance. Most board games come with their own instruction books, so
   that's easy enough. Read the rules aloud and discuss them as you go
   along so everyone knows what to expect when the game begins. There are
   many games that are passed down to us that have no written
   instructions. This book will help clear up the confusion on these
   games, so read on, and then read out loud.

--
   the way to fair play. If you're a frequent player, keep a log of the
   rules handy, and add to this log as you redefine the games with new
   rules.

    3. Describe how video games can be used for educational purposes.
    4. Identify the arguments for and against the depiction of video games
       as an art.
--
   An NPD poll conducted in 2007 found that 72 percent of the U.S.
   population had played a video game that year (Faylor, 2008). The
   increasing number of people playing video games means that video games
   are having an undeniable effect on culture. This effect is clearly
   visible in the increasing mainstream acceptance of aspects of gaming
   culture. Video games have also changed the way that many other forms of
   media, from music to film, are produced and consumed. Education has
   also been changed by video games through the use of new technologies
   that help teachers and students communicate in new ways through
   educational games such as Brain Age. As video games have an increasing
   influence on our culture, many have voiced their opinions on whether
--

Game Culture

   To fully understand the effects of video games on mainstream culture,
   it is important to understand the development of gaming culture, or the
   culture surrounding video games. Video games, like books or movies,
   have avid users who have made this form of media central to their
   lives. In the early 1970s, programmers got together in groups to play
   Spacewar!, spending a great deal of time competing in a game that was
   rudimentary compared to modern games (Brand). As video arcades and home
   video game consoles gained in popularity, youth culture quickly adapted
   to this type of media, engaging in competitions to gain high scores and
--
   In the 1980s, an increasing number of kids were spending time on
   consoles playing games and, more importantly, increasingly identifying
   with the characters and products associated with the games. Saturday
   morning cartoons were made out of the Pac-Man and Super Mario Bros.
   games, and an array of nongame merchandise was sold with video game
   logos and characters. The public recognition of some of these
--
   As the kids who first played Super Mario Bros. began to outgrow video
   games, companies such as Sega, and later Sony and Microsoft, began
   making games to appeal to older demographics. This has increased the
   average age of video game players, which was 35 in 2009 (Entertainment
   Software Association, 2009). The Nintendo Wii has even found a new
--
   popular form of entertainment for the residents (Wischnowsky). The
   gradual increase in gaming age has led to an acceptance of video games
   as an acceptable form of mainstream entertainment.
--

   The acceptance of video games in mainstream culture has consequently
   changed the way that the culture views certain people. “Geek” was the
--
   society, favored imaginary worlds such as those found in the fantasy
   and science fiction genres. Video games were appealing because they
   were both a fantasy world and a means to excel at something. Jim
--

   Video games gave a group of excluded people a way to gain proficiency
   in the social realm. As video games became more of a mainstream
   phenomenon and video game skills began to be desired by a large number
   of people, the popular idea of geeks changed. It is now common to see
--
   acceptance of geek culture has led to acceptance of geek aesthetics.
   The mainstreaming of video games has led to acceptance of fantasy or
   virtual worlds. This is evident in the popularity of film/book series
--
   worlds such as those represented in the Grand Theft Auto and Halo
   series and online games such as World of Warcraft have expanded the
   idea of virtual worlds so that they are not mere means of escape but
--

The Effects of Video Games on Other Types of Media

   Video games during the 1970s and ’80s were often derivatives of other
   forms of media. E.T., Star Wars, and a number of other games took their
   cues from movies, television shows, and books. This began to change in
   the 1980s with the development of cartoons based on video games, and in
   the 1990s and 2000s with live-action feature films based on video
   games.

--

   Television programs based on video games were an early phenomenon.
   Pac-Man, Pole Position, and Q*bert were among the animated programs
--
   Super Mario Bros. Super Show! and The Legend of Zelda promoted Nintendo
   games. In the 1990s, Pokémon, originally a game developed for the
   Nintendo Game Boy, was turned into a television series, a card game,
   several movies, and even a musical (Internet Movie Database). Recently,
   several programs have been developed that revolve entirely around video
   games—the web series The Guild, for instance, tells the story of a
   group of friends who interact through an unspecified MMORPG.
--
   Nielsen, the company that tabulates television ratings, has begun
   rating video games in a similar fashion. In 2010, this information
   showed that video games, as a whole, could be considered a kind of
   fifth network, along with the television networks NBC, ABC, CBS, and
--
   programs to support. The use of this system is changing public
   perceptions to include video game playing as a habit similar to
   television watching.

   Video games have also influenced the way that television is produced.
   The Rocket Racing League, scheduled to be launched in 2011, will
--
   with a public that has come to demand and rely on the kind of
   interactivity that video games provide.

--

   The rise in film adaptations of video games accompanies the increased
   age of video game users. In 1995, Mortal Kombat, a live-action movie
   based on the video game, grossed over $70 million at the box office,
   placing it 22nd in the rankings for that year (Box Office Mojo). Lara
--
   and 15th overall for the year (Box Office Mojo). Films based on video
   games are an increasingly common sight at the box office, such as
   producer Jerry Bruckheimer’s Prince of Persia, or the recent sequel to
--

   Another aspect of video games’ influence on films is how video game
   releases are marketed and perceived. The release date for anticipated
   game Grand Theft Auto IV was announced and marketed to compete with the
   release of the film Iron Man. Grand Theft Auto IV supposedly beat Iron
   Man by $300 million in sales. This kind of comparison is, in some ways,
   misleading. Video games cost much more than a ticket to a movie, so
   higher sales does not mean that more people bought the game than the
   movie. Also, the distribution apparatus for the two media is totally
   different. Movies can only be released in theaters, whereas video games
   can be sold at any retail outlet (Associated Press, 2008). What this
   kind of news story proves, however, is that the general public
   considers video games as something akin to a film. It is also important
   to realize that the scale of production and profit for video games is
   similar to that of films. Video games include music scores, actors, and
   directors in addition to the game designers, and the budgets for major
   games reflect this. Grand Theft Auto IV cost an estimated $100 million
   to produce (Bowditch, 2008).
--

   Video games have been accompanied by music ever since the days of the
   arcade. Video game music was originally limited to computer beeps
   turned into theme songs. The design of the Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn,
   and Sony PlayStation made it possible to use sampled audio on new
   games, meaning songs played on physical instruments could be recorded
   and used on video games. Beginning with the music of the Final Fantasy
   series, scored by famed composer Nobuo Uematsu, video game music took
   on film score quality, complete with full orchestral and vocal tracks.
--
   musicians such as Trent Reznor, Thomas Dolby, Steve Vai, and Joe
   Satriani were able to create the soundtracks for popular games, giving
   these artists exposure to new generations of potential fans (Video
   Games Music Big Hit, 1997). Composing music for video games has turned
   into a profitable means of employment for many musicians. Schools such
   as Berklee College of Music, Yale, and New York University have
   programs that focus on composing music for video games. The students
   are taught many of the same principles that are involved in film
--
   Many rock bands have allowed their previously recorded songs to be used
   in video games, similar to a hit song being used on a movie soundtrack.
   The bands are paid for the rights to use the song, and their music is
   exposed to an audience that otherwise might not hear it. As mentioned
   earlier, games like Rock Band and Guitar Hero have been used to promote
   bands. The release of The Beatles: Rock Band was timed to coincide with
--

   Another phenomenon relating to music and video games involves musicians
   covering video game music. A number of bands perform only video game
   covers in a variety of styles, such as the popular Japanese group the
   Black Mages, which performs rock versions of Final Fantasy music.
   Playing video game themes is not limited to rock bands, however. An
   orchestra and chorus called Video Games Live started a tour in 2005
   dedicated to playing well-known video game music. Their performances
   are often accompanied by graphics projected onto a screen showing
   relevant sequences from the video games (Play Symphony).

--

   Recently, the connection between video games and other media has
   increased with the popularity of machinima, animated films and series
   created by recording character actions inside video games. Beginning
   with the short film “Diary of a Camper,” filmed inside the game Quake
   in 1996, fans of video games have adopted the technique of machinima to
   tell their own stories. Although these early movies were released only

Video Games and Education

--

   Figure 10.7 Educational video games have proven to be useful tools for
   educators.

   One sign of the mainstreaming of video games is the increase of
   educational institutions that embrace them. As early as the 1980s,
   games such as Number Munchers and Word Munchers were designed to help
   children develop basic math and grammar skills. In 2006, the Federation
   of American Scientists completed a study that approved of video game
   use in education. The study cited the fact that video game systems were
   present in most households, kids favored learning through video games,
   and games could be used to facilitate analytical skills (Feller, 2006).
   Another study, published in the science journal Nature in 2002, found
   that regular video game players had better developed visual-processing
   skills than people who did not play video games. Participants in the
   test were asked to play a first-person shooter game for 1 hour a day
   for 10 days, and were then tested for specific visual attention skills.
   The playing improved these skills in all participants, but the regular
   video game players had a greater skill level than the non–game players.
   According to the study, “Although video-game playing may seem to be
   rather mindless, it is capable of radically altering visual attention
--

   Other educational institutions have begun to embrace video games as
   well. The Boy Scouts of America have created a “belt loop,” something
   akin to a merit badge, for tasks including learning to play a
   parent-approved game and developing a schedule to balance video game
   time with homework (Murphy, 2010). The federal government has also seen
   the educational potential of video games. A commission on balancing the
   federal budget suggested a video game that would educate Americans
   about the necessary costs of balancing the federal budget (Wolf, 2010).
   The military has similarly embraced video games as training simulators
   for new soldiers. These simulators, working off of newer game
   technologies, present several different realistic options that soldiers
   could face on the field. The games have also been used as recruiting
   tools by the U.S. Army and the Army National Guard (Associated Press,
--

   The ultimate effect of video game use for education, whether in schools
   or in the public arena, means that video games have been validated by
   established cultural authorities. Many individuals still resist the
   idea that video games can be beneficial or have a positive cultural
   influence, but their embrace by educational institutions has given
   video games validation.

Video Games as Art

   While universally accepted as a form of media, a debate has recently
   arisen over whether video games can be considered a form of art. Roger
   Ebert, the well-known film critic, has historically argued that “video
   games can never be art,” citing the fact that video games are meant to
   be won, whereas art is meant to be experienced (Ebert, 2010).
--
   His remarks have generated an outcry from both video gamers and
   developers. Many point to games such as 2009’s Flower, in which players
   control the flow of flower petals in the wind, as examples of video
   games developing into art. Flower avoids specific plot and characters
   to allow the player to focus on interaction with the landscape and the
   emotion of the game-play (That Game Company). Likewise, more mainstream
   games such as the popular Katamari series, released in 2004, are built
   around the idea of creation, requiring players to pull together a

   Video games, once viewed as a mindless source of entertainment, are now
   being featured in publications such as The New Yorker magazine and The
--
   complex musical scores and the advent of machinima, the boundaries
   between video games and other forms of media are slowly blurring. While
   they may not be considered art by everyone, video games have
   contributed significantly to modern artistic culture.
--
       interaction.
     * Video games have gone from being a derivative medium that took its
       cues from other media, such as books, films, and music, to being a
       form of media that other types derive new ideas from. Video games
       have also interacted with older forms of media to change them and
       create new means of entertainment and interaction.
     * Educational institutions have embraced the use of video games as
       valuable tools for teaching. These tools include simulated worlds
       in which important life skills can be learned and improved.
     * While video games may not be accepted by everyone as a form of art,
       there is no doubt that they contribute greatly to artistic media
--

   Think about the ways in which video games have influenced and affected
   other forms of media. Then consider the following questions:
    1. Are there things video games will never be able to offer?
    2. Write down several examples of ways in which other forms of media
       are not replicated by video games. Then speculate on ways video
       games could eventually emulate these forms.

4 Reasons Why You Should Be Advertising in Video Games

--
   Gamers are now nearly synonymous with everyday consumers, and it’s time
   for advertisers to pay attention. Advertising in video games, also
   known as in-game advertising, will help you tap into a growing and
   engaged audience.
--
   This upward trend points to the growing opportunity to reach engaged
   audiences through video game ads. In-game advertising leverages
   programmatic to enable ads to appear in mobile, computer, and video

   don’t interrupt gameplay.

What Are In-Game Ads

   Blended in-game ads appear on in-game objects such as billboards,
   walls, jerseys, and more during gameplay. The goal of blended in-game
   advertising is to insert ads that get noticed while not interrupting
   the player’s enjoyment of the game.

   They are non-intrusive, highly-viewable and drive high brand recall.
   Blended in-game ads can be delivered through programmatic advertising
   on gaming consoles, mobile devices, or on PCs.

   Blended in-game inventory can be run at scale across impactful
   suppliers and platforms around the world.

What Are Two Common Blended In-Game Ad Units

Psychosocial Impacts of Mobile Game on K12 Students and Trend Exploration for
Future Educational Mobile Games

--

   Due to the popularity and advancement of 4G/5G networks, mobile games
   have already currently become profitable tools for major internet
   platforms. These games are even refined to cover almost all age groups
   of the population rather than the young people. Yet in the perception
   of the public, mobile games have always seemed to be associated with
   various derogatory terms such as interfering with learning, addiction,
   and violence. K12 students usually have less self-control capability,
   and they are undoubtedly the biggest advocates of mobile games. This
   paper summarizes the technological development of mobile games from the
   aspects of hardware and software in chronological order. The
   psychological and social problems that mobile games have brought to K12
   students are analyzed from a neutral perspective. At the end of the
   paper, the future development of educational games and current
   limitations of mobile games are also given for the explorations of
   future trends of game-based education. This position paper aims to
   provide the insight of what psychosocial impacts that the current
   mobile games have on the student, and it may also serve as a reference
   for the how the game-based education has been developing according to
   the mobile technology wise.

   Due to the popularity of smart terminals and the advancement of 5G
   networks, mobile games are currently the most popular type of games, as
   well as profitable tools for major internet platforms. Mobile games can
   be combined from different levels and content categories, covering
   different, personalities and preferences (Martin et al., 2020). As a
   result mobile games are now refined to cover almost all age groups of
   the population, not just young people. Yet in the perception of the
   public, mobile games have always seemed to be associated with various
   derogatory terms such as interfering with learning, addiction and
--
   self-control capability, and they are undoubtedly the biggest advocates
   of mobile game. When they play certain games for long periods of time
   their behavior and psychological state will be changed in a subtle way.
   The main issue is that mobile games may contain unhealthy contents such
   as pornography, violence, ignorance, superstition, etc. which
--
   (Destyanto et al., 2017). In addition, some young people indulge in
   mobile games due to lack of self-control, which not only result in
   harmful influence on their studies but also induces a series of
--
   that modern mass media have a clear negative function of
   “psychoanesthesia.” Some violent mobile games reveal the nature of the
   “psychoanesthesia” function in another textual dimension: they create
--
   cultural way (Kurt et al., 2022). Craig Anderson found that the
   “psychoanesthetic” mechanism of violent mobile games increases the
   physiological arousal of aggressive behavior, cognition, emotions, and
--
   violent behavior has become the main “product component” of mobile
   games “inflicted” on adolescents. Moreover, its basic social
   manifestations can be summarized in four points: firstly, it creates
--
   secondly, it weakens the inhibition process of violence; thirdly, the
   game’s violent reward rules allow aggressive behavior to be imitated
   and reinforced in the “mimetic environment;” and fourthly, the binary
   values of right and wrong in games can reduce young people’s empathy
   (Elsherbiny and Al Maamari, 2021).

   Mobile games do not only imply a behavior, but also contain a value,
   which might be sometimes anti-social in nature. Violent mobile games on
   the Internet may portray the grandeur, hooliganism, and banditry of
--
   adolescent violence. In particular, the propaganda of “materialism” in
   violent online games can easily lead young people to abandon their
   original morals and values, so that the “money first” mentality

   This position paper therefore infer the future development of
   educational games from existing mobile games, and shares some insights
   into the current limitations, and critically analyses the above issues
   from a neutral perspective, discusses the psychological impacts and
   social problems that mobile games may cause for K12 students (Arteaga
   et al., 2012). It also offers the future development of mobile games
   and the limitations of current educational games in order to explore
   future trends in gamified education. This paper can also be considered

Technological Development of Mobile Game

--
   Nowadays, almost everyone who owns a smartphone has been exposed to
   mobile games at one time or another. It may be a mini-game embedded in
   a web page or app, or a large 3D online game like “Arena of Alor” or
   “Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds” (De Gloria et al., 2014). These games
   have a huge update from the mobile games of over a decade ago, both in
   scale and in audio and video experience. And most mobile phones now

   mobile phones, which did not exist on the same level mobile phones in
   10 years ago, which has promoted the development of mobile games

   requirement for gamers was that their phones could run a particular
   game, but now gamers want smoother games, no lag when playing online,
   and even want their phones to be able to turn on the highest picture
   quality of the game (Ma et al., 2019). This means that the hardware
   that provides key performance in the phone and the network environment

   diverse needs of gamers (Wang et al., 2020). Gradually, mobile phones
   and mobile games have worked together to promote growth and form the
   industry shape we see today. In addition to entertainment, mobile games
   also carry part of people’s social needs in their daily lives (Yang and

   only the games built into the phone could be played, such as Snake,
   Tetris, etc (Figure 1). These were indeed interesting, but they were

   mobile games did not exceed 1 MB in size until the new Symbian system
   appeared in 2006, when these restrictions were lifted one by one (de

   The popularity of color-screened phones allowed game developers to see
   the opportunity, and some very well-known games such as Need for Speed,
   Call of Duty, Command and Conquer, and many others launched dedicated
   mobile versions (Berlo et al., 2020). Many small development teams and
   enthusiasts also developed board games such as chess, Texas hold’em
   into mobile versions. A variety of mobile phone native games began to
   appear at this time, such as “Tower Bloxx” and “Galaxy on Fire” in 2005
   were enjoyable for handheld gamers at the time (Haney, 2017). Around
   2005, when client-side mobile games were just exploding, there were
   already many specialized game makers developing mobile games for
   non-smartphones, but limited by the speed and stability of cell phone

   In 2008, with the birth of iOS and Android, Apple successfully

   The introduction of Angry Birds made the public realize for the first
   time that the era of mobile games may be coming (Kalogiannakis et al.,
   2022).

   “Angry Birds”, developed by Rovio and launched in 2009, is another
   phenomenal product. Throughout the game, gamers only need to do one

   operation overturned the public’s inherent impression of how mobile
   games are presented, so Fruit Ninja and Cut the Rope, launched a year

   developers at this time is much shabbier compared with today (Bagaa et

   China was “World War II Storm,” and its monthly flow was only $800,000

   ushered in the 4G era (Karabiyik et al., 2020). In 2014, the real-time
   competitive MOBA hand game “Vainglory” was launched, emphasizing the
   real-time nature of network online, while “Magic Spirit Summoning,”
   “Tower Legend” and other nurturing RPG games, although the gameplay is
   focused on the standalone part, the official will regularly update a
   large amount of game content to keep the game fresh and the passion of
   gamers, so an efficient network becomes very important (Wang et al.,

   rate of 1 Gbps, greatly increasing wireless data bandwidth and enabling
   mobile games with less hourly delay and faster rate, giving gamers a
   better and faster gaming experience (Zappone et al., 2016). Mobile

   cross-religious entertainment. It allows gamers to realize the ability

   downloaded to gamers’ phones faster (Buzzi et al., 2012).
--
   In 2015, “Arena of Alor” was publicly tested together with “We MOBA”
   and other multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, and most
   handheld gamers were brought into the tide of MOBA games (Buzzi et al.,
   2016). These games are not only fast to get started, but also have
   compact gameplay and gorgeous graphics effects, which not only require
--
   (Zhang et al., 2017). The complex lighting and particle effects in the
   game make the CPU and GPU in the SoC take a lot of pressure; at this
   time, the modem in the phone can’t be idle and needs to coordinate the
   network to cope with transferring the various data that occur in the
   game. Such comprehensive needs have led more cell phone manufacturers
   to start launching products that emphasize cell phone performance and

   This trend has prompted more developers to bring a wider variety of
   games with richer titles to the mobile platform. Almost every year,
   several topical titles emerge, such as “Crackdown 3” in 2016, “Monument
   Valley 2” in 2017, and “World in Pictures” and “Florence” in 2018,
   which expose more smartphone users to the “video game” entertainment
   genre (Guo et al., 2019). For most gamers, the connected competitive
   games like 2018’s Peaceful Elite handheld, Wild Ride 9: Racing Legends
   and the new Call of Duty Mobile in 2019 are their best choices (Guo et

   smartphones, not only cell phones have changed over the past 10 years,

Psychosocial Effect of Mobile Game on K12 Children Education Performance

Public Awareness—Negative Content of Mobile Game

   Many elementary school students are addicted to mobile games and cannot
   extricate themselves from games, some of them even steal their parents’
   money to recharge for playing games and play truant. They only think
   about the mobile games all day and all night, and think of all the ways
   to play games, so they are not interested in studying at all and their
   academic performance is in a mess. It seems obvious that the more time
   you spend playing games, the worse your academic performance, and there
   are studies that have found a correlation between time spent on video
   games and students’ academic performance (Padilla-Walker et al., 2009).
   But is poor academic performance really the fault of gaming? It is
--
   appreciation and has high expectations of himself, has no outlet for
   his pent-up emotions. But in mobile games he can not only vent his
   stress but also receive a quick reward (Chafouleas et al., 2021). The
   situation of students who are already not excelling in their academic
   performance will get worse because playing games will waste time in
   learning, thus creating a vicious circle (Laws and Millward, 2001),
   i.e., although playing games takes away from our studies, playing games
   may only be one point in the chain, and the reasons that lead us to
   play games are actually more complex.

Why Are Games Addictive but Learning Is Usually NOT?

   Compared with learning, mobile games have distinct advantages that
   games tend to have some measure the progress of participants to some
   extent, meaning that their effort is visible and obvious, whereas
--
   that “hard work doesn’t always lead to progress” (Chen and Gregory,
   2009). The game makes this process visible, turning a large amount into
   many tiny amounts, and it is important to feel that you are improving.
--

   The tasks set in the game are mostly achievable goals, not too easy and
   not too hard. There is a lot of data analysis behind this degree of
   accuracy (Wang et al., 2020). Increasing participation in games is
   linked to their benefits and results. Not so with learning. The average
--

   The game does such a good job of this. It is clear on the game that for
   everything you achieve, you will be rewarded accordingly and your

   If we could figure out how humans learn and what motivates people to
   act from the development of games, then apply it beyond games, the
   value it could create is immeasurable, and it would be a

The Psychosocial Impact of Mobile Games

   In fact, the psychosocial mechanisms behind playing games deserve more
   attention than academic performance. Often the decline in academic
   performance is the most easily observed, but the relationship between
   playing video games and soft aspects such as feelings of loneliness,
   loss, self-esteem, social anxiety and social skills is often
   overlooked. These commonly overlooked factors largely contribute to
   negative events that influence our perceptions of mobile games (Han et
   al., 2009).
--
   lonely, lack social skills, and are less successful in real life tend
   to spend more time in video games (Winter et al., 2016). In turn,
   playing video games further exacerbates gamers’ feelings of loneliness
   and increased dissatisfaction with life (Kowert et al., 2015).
--

   A successful mobile game is inevitably appealing because of the high
   sense of achievement that teenagers can feel in the game again. Imagine
   that people who are not respected in real life can be admired for their
   virtual achievements in the game, either through kryptonite (spending
   money to increase combat power) or through their skill in playing the
   game. Even if you don’t make it to the top of the leader boards, you
   can still find a presence in a variety of ways. Moreover, in online
   games, without the constraints of real identities and conditions,
   gamers can communicate more flexibly and with less embarrassment of
--
   These people who are dissatisfied with their real lives can find a
   sense of presence in the game in a variety of ways to escape their
   real-life dissatisfaction (Figure 4). However, after being satisfied in

Anti-social Behavior Caused by Mobile Games

   The content of many mobile games is full of fighting and killing,
   gunfire, wild and weird characters, mechanical and rough movements,
--
   students’ moral and psychological health. Those students who are
   addicted to games are often not calm enough, restless, impulsive,
   indifferent to others, and more violent, bringing certain destabilizing
--
   schizophrenia symptoms, and few children who are addicted to mobile
   games are psychologically healthy. Nowadays, anti-social behavior also
   brings much attention to mobile game study. Although video games have
   been designed and developed to entertain (or educate), it has to be
--
   children’s learning and development, as early as 15 years ago, 89% of
   all games contained violent content, and nearly half of them contained
   severe violence (Bulduklu, 2017).

   Researchers have found that excessive immersion in games with
   antisocial content (violence) can easily lead to addiction and that
   such games have a subtle effect on gamers: they lack empathy and are
   prone to destructive behavior in real life. In fact, for gamers, the
--
   become accustomed to such aggressive emotions and destructive behavior
   in games, which they gradually carry over into real life (Huizenga et
   al., 2009).
--
   In a study conducted in 2011, Anderson and Bushman surveyed over 4,000
   gamers and found that violent games increased aggressive emotions and
   decreased pro-social behaviour. Both children and adults, men and women
--
   say that violent play necessarily leads to violent behavior. However,
   when we are constantly trained to think about our enemies in games and
   reinforced to react quickly and aggressively to each other’s actions,
--

   It must be clear here that it is not the video game that causes the
   gamer’s antisocial behavior, but the violent content of the video game.
   It is pointless and even counterproductive to make a blanket statement.
   We should advocate for the regulation of the video game market and the
   development of sensible game content, rather than a blanket ban on all
   video games.

The Core Educational Value of Mobile Games

   Most scholars are studying how to make learning more interesting, so
   that students can learn by doing as what the mobile game does. This is
   the dream of our educational researchers, and Dewey’s emphasis on
--
   educational scholars are proposing to implement gamified learning,
   using educational games to achieve gamified learning. Gamified learning
   in a narrow sense generally refers to pure video games, while gamified
   learning in a broad sense includes game mechanics, game element design
   concepts, etc.

   The core educational values of games are mainly acting on the aspects
   of psychology, socialization, and culture. With its effect on play
   motivation, playful thinking, and playfulness (Figure 5), a good mobile
   game does need multiple aspects of knowledge, ability, emotions,
   attitudes and values (Schwab, 2018). Play motivation is the most
--
   and emphasizes the design of non-playful learning activities as
   “games.” Playfulness is the most meaningful value emphasizing that
   learners approach the process and outcomes of learning with the same

Gamification of Education/Educational Mobile Games

--
   Gamification of education is more suitable for the K12 age group and
   should generally be in the form of simple games, with the degree of
   gamification decreasing with the age of the user increasing; there will
   be some adults over 18 who prefer educational products in the form of
   large-scale games such as online games, but this may be a niche market
   (Abeele et al., 2017). A light game should be a balance between
   learning and gameplay, it is like a layer of ketchup in the middle of a
   hamburger, it can be a little less, but too much is definitely not. If
   the game is too complex, it will take away from the main focus, the
   child will appear to be learning but spend more time playing, and the
--
   solution, not optional. Otherwise, even the best design will be
   short-lived and will end up like a normal game after its life cycle.
   So, as well as the product team, the operations team is equally

Future Trends and Limitations in Educational Mobile Games

   et al., 2016; Black et al., 2018). If the research is to solve
   students’ learning problems through mobile games, it is necessary to
   combine various research results and educational results from game
   design. Experimental research in this area has been conducted and found
   it to be quite effective. Through this experiment, it is found that the
   difficulty in developing this type of game is decided by how it can
   really enhance their learning effectiveness (Calpbinici and Tas Arslan,

   Still, games are games, and still there are four major limitation for
   the current development of educational mobile games.:

   • The first major limitation is portability, that is, how what is
   learned in a mobile game transfers to the real world, which exposes the
   Achilles heel of mobile games. The challenges in video games are often
   fictional and have no connection to everyday life, but are rather a
   fantasy. The knowledge and skills that K12 students acquire in games
   such as battling dragons, racing jousts, and Tetris are not meaningful
--

   • The second major limitation is simplicity. Mobile games simplify
   complex systems to their core and are procedural representations of the
   real world. The world we live in is much more complex and often defies
   the simple logic of the game. This results in learners often losing
   touch with the systems modeled in the game.

   • The third major limitation is that games lack real-life environments.
   Mobile games are not designed to have an effect on the gamer after the
   game is over. The K12 students are too different from the world they
   live in, and the real world is too complex. Even those games that have
   a realistic purpose, so-called serious games or educational games,
   mostly fail in their transfer from the game to the real world. This is
   good news for those who fear that violent games make people violent,
   and bad news for those who think that smart games automatically make
   people smart.
--
   environment. K12 students are usually unable to spontaneously establish
   a relationship between what they learn in mobile games and real life.
   They can grasp a great deal of information in mobile games and remember
   it over time, but are unable to recall the simplest historical data in
   the classroom. The link between learning achievements in games and in
   the real world is often overlooked by many K12 students and teachers.

   Games open the door to the transfer of learning experiences, but K12
   students must go through this door themselves. For that matter, the
   role of teaching behavior in the use of mobile games is clearly
   underestimated. Learners need constructive support to draw outcomes
--
   but there is a difference in the logical growth and understanding of
   games (Rahim et al., 2020). Besides, the illusory nature of the mobile
   gaming experience makes the transfer of results very difficult. In
--
   that need to be answered on the teaching side are which real-world
   environments can apply what is learned in the game and which aspects of
   the game are worth learning from. And gamers, the K12 students, should
   be motivated to notice this connection and to test what they have
--

   This paper summarizes the technological development of mobile games
   from the aspects of hardware and software. A neutral perspective is
   given to analyze the psychological and social problems that mobile
   games have brought to K12 students. At the end of the paper, the
   insights of the future development of educational games and current
   limitations of mobile games are also addressed. The major task for the
   development is to reflect on the content of the mobile game, which is
   not directly accessible. It is difficult to examine what is learned

   Advertising in video games is the integration of advertising into video
   games to promote products, organizations, or viewpoints.^[1]

   There are two major categories of advertising in video games: in-game
   advertising and advergames.^[2] In-game advertising shows the player
   advertisements while playing the game,^[3] whereas advergames are a
   type of game created to serve as an advertisement for a brand or
   product.^[4]

   Other methods of advertising in video games include in-game product
   placement and sponsorship of commercial games or other game-related
   content.^[5]

--

   In-game advertising is similar to product placement in films and
   television, where the advertising content exists within the universe of
   the characters. These forms of product placement are common, which led
   to the advertisement technique being applied to video games to match
   evolving media consumption habits.^[6]^[7] According to the
   Entertainment Software Association in 2010, 42% of gamers said they
   play online games one or more hours per week.^[8] Game playing is
   considered active media consumption, which provides a unique
   opportunity for advertisers. The principal advantages of product
   placement in gaming are visibility and notoriety. A single in-game
   advertisement may be encountered by the player multiple times, and
   advertisers have an opportunity to ally a brand's image with that of a
   well-received game.

--
   sponsored product placement, and the interplay between the player and
   these elements in the game allow for a great degree of virtual
   advertisement.^[9] Examples of marketing in video games include brand
   integration, embedded marketing, recruitment tools, edutainment, and
   traditional in-game advertising.

   According to Forbes, in-game advertising is expected to reach $7.2
   billion in 2016.^[10] Unlike television commercials and digital ads,
   which can be avoided by using DVRs and ad-blocking software,
   advertisements embedded within video games cannot be bypassed. A more
   recent example of in-game advertising is Google's placement of video
   ads between levels of games. These ads are usually branded inline, and
   TechCrunch reports that they have the potential to gain fast traction
--

Static in-game advertising[edit]

   Static in-game advertisements are embedded into the video game
   program.^[9] Static ads can be used in the story-line of the game and
   players can interact with them.^[9] The creation of the ads can take
--

Dynamic in-game advertising[edit]

   Dynamic in-game advertisements are embedded in online video games that
   can be changed at any time by the game programmers.^[9]^[6] Examples of
   this type of advertisement would be virtual billboards and updates that
   introduce new items into the game like clothing brands to dress
   characters or different cars.^[6] Dynamics ads are different from
   static games because companies can provide ads for specific audiences
   or demographics after the video game has been purchased by the
   consumer.^[6] This way companies can follow the consumer habits and
   provide ads that can address a certain context.^[6] Game developers
   then can dynamically change the virtual ads spaces embedded into the
   game to display the ads.^[7] Players have a limited interaction with
   these ads compared to static in-game ads.^[9] These ads required active
   Internet connection for the game company to showcase the ads.^[9]
   Dynamic ads can accommodate time sensitive campaigns and can be shown
   immediately.^[9] These ads can also provide data to show how well
   campaigns are doing unlike static in-game ads.^[9]

Advergames[edit]

   Main article: Advergame

   Video games that are expressly commissioned to promote a product or
   service are referred to as "advergames", a portmanteau of "advertising"
   and "gaming". This term was coined in January 2000 by Anthony
   Giallourakis and later mentioned by Wired's "Jargon Watch" column in
   2001.^[12] Advergames have been developed for different platforms
   including company websites, gaming consoles, and more recently, mobile
   applications and social media platforms.^[13] With the growth of the
   Internet, advergames have proliferated, often becoming the most visited
   aspect of brand websites and becoming an integrated part of brand media
   planning. The advergames sector reached $207 million in 2007.^[14]

   The earliest custom video games featuring integrated brand messages
   were developed and distributed on floppy disk.^[15] These games were
   distributed for free, often bundled with other products from the
   company advertised for. The first floppy disk advergames were developed
   to serve dual purposes—as promotional incentives that drive response
   and as media that deliver awareness. American Home Foods Chef Boyardee
   issued one of the earliest floppy-disk advergames.^[16] Some brands,
   like Kool-Aid and Pepsi, created early advergames on gaming platforms.
   They created advergames for the Atari 2600 and gave out promotional
   copies.^[15] The first in-box CD-ROM cereal box advergames are General
   Mills's Chex Quest (promoting the Chex brand) and General Mills's

   Commercial examples include advergames funded by Pepsi, 7 Up, NFL,
   Formula One, and Burger King. Political and military examples of
   below-the-line (BTL) advergames include recruitment tools like
   America's Army, intended to boost recruitment for the United States

   state of Israel. Educational advergaming is closely related to the
   Serious games initiative and falls under either Edumarket gaming or

   Examples of through-the-line (TTL) advertising in games include
   "link-chases," ARGs, and viral marketing.

   TTL marketing is a form of advertising in video games that involve the
   use of URL hyperlinks within the game designed to induce the player to
   visit a web page which then contains BTL advertisements. The technique
   used to tempt the player into visiting the intended URL varies from
   game to game.^[17] In games like Pikmin 2, the player is given a
   cryptic message with an accompanying URL designed to pique their
   curiosity. In games such as Enter the Matrix, Year Zero, I Love Bees,
   and Lost Experience, URLs make up a part of the background of the game
   such that certain plot details can only be learned by following the
   link. The knowledge of such plot details are typically not required to
   complete the game, but deepen the game story-line for players who
   follow the links. Websites of this nature often lead players on to
   other links which again lead to further links, thus earning these games
   the label "link-chases". Although TTL advertising can be an enjoyable
   experience for players, excessive "link-chasing" can feel obstructive
   and discourage them from diving deeper into a game's story-line. In
   another form, the URL might be part of a stage where a player can see

   In 2019, a survey conducted by deltaDNA found that 94% of free-to-play
   video game developers incorporate some form of in-game
   advertising.^[18] Among those, the most common type of advertisement
   were rewarded videos, which are videos that players can watch to earn
   in-game prizes.^[18] Rewarded videos are shown to be more effective
   than forced advertising; players are 23% more likely to buy products
--

   The reaction to in-game advertising has been overall positive, with 73%
   of players being happy with ad-funded games.^[19]

   The effectiveness of advertising in video games is debated by
   scholars.^[3]^[20]^[21] Brand name recognition in sports game has been
   shown to be low among college students, although players did retain
   fragments of the brand names.^[3] Another study found that 35% of
   players could recall advertised brands in car racing games.^[20]
   Interactive in-game advertisements, such as brand products that are
   used in game, are shown to produce greater brand awareness and more
   positive brand attitudes than passively added advertisements, such as

   Mobile in-game advertisements are advertisements within mobile games
   that lead the user to the website or installation page of the
--
   portions of the screen while the user continues to interact with the
   mobile game.^[23] Pop-up ads will display the advertisement on the
   entire mobile screen, typically disrupting gameplay; they appear
   between loading screens or when in-game milestones are completed, only
   allowing users to close the pop-up ad once a timer runs out.^[24] Video

   that allows the user to interact with the advertisement.^[26] For
   instance, Candy Crush Saga, a free-to-play mobile game, uses playable
   ads to advertise their game on other mobile applications and provide
   potential customers with a demo of their game.^[27] In 2019, mobile
   advertising contributed $39.9 billion in revenue to the mobile gaming

   The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) assigns ratings based on
   a detailed questionnaire about the game's content and a gameplay clip
   provided by the publisher.^[29] Possible rating categories are
--
   "Blood", "Partial Nudity", and "Use of Alcohol".^[30] All updates and
   downloadable content (DLC), including both static and dynamic in-game
   advertising, are expected to be compliant with the game's rating and
   descriptors, though DLC can be submitted for its own, independent
--
   If any post-release content is determined to be incompatible with the
   rating of the base game, publishers are required to update all physical
   and digital displays of the rating.^[29] In the case of physical games,
   where it is difficult to make these modifications once a game has
   shipped, sanctions and fines may be levied on the publisher.^[29]
--
   The ESRB also includes an Advertising Review Council (ARC) that
   oversees the marketing of video games in the United States and
   Canada.^[32] Cross-promotion, including when a video game is promoted
   within another, falls under this umbrella.^[32] The ARC ensures that
   the game being advertised is accurately represented and is not being
   marketed toward parties below the suitable age range.^[32]
--
   The University of Bath's Institute for Policy Research researched the
   use of advergames in marketing to children in the United Kingdom.^[33]
   The report, published in June 2014, suggested that children as old as
   15 did not recognize that advergames were adverts and had their food
   choices influenced without their conscious awareness.^[34] Based on
   these findings, the University called for "urgent government action to
   protect children from the subconscious effects of advergames."^[33]

Targeted advergame marketing[edit]

   A bill was recently introduced in the Senate that proposes restrictions
   on the use of information obtained through advergames to market to
   children. Some games ask users to provide personal information, such as
   name, gender, and age, then display targeted advertisements based on
   these characteristics. This bill would prevent companies from using
   this information to change the game to target certain age brackets.
