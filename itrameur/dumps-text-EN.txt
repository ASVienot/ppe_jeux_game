   In this time of quarantine and isolation, we all need to keep up both
   our social interactions and our spirits. Playing video GAME with
   friends online is the perfect solution. You don’t have to be good at
   them, that’s not the point – online GAME provide a location to meet
   up, chat and have experiences together that may or may not involve
   blowing stuff up.

   Here is a range of titles that can be learned and enjoyed by both
   complete beginners and veteran gamers. Whether you have an old laptop
   or the latest smartphone, there’s something here you can play with pals
   even if they’re far away.

Console GAME – Keith Stuart

   The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are excellent machines for playing with
   and against remote friends. They’re easy to set up online (you’ll need
   to pay a fee of around £45 a year for access) and they both have very
   intuitive “Party Chat” functions which let you talk to your friends via
   a gaming headset while playing – in fact you can chat between GAME
   too, or even while watching Netflix on your console. Things are a bit
   more complicated on Nintendo Switch which requires you to download a
   mobile phone app in order to chat with friends, but even then only a
   minority of GAME support the feature. So all our recommendations are
   primarily based on Xbox and PlayStation.

   Minecraft
   (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, smartphone)
   The most popular video GAME in the world allows groups of eight players
   to meet online, explore vast blocky worlds and construct amazing
   buildings together. Think of it as a cross between a Lego set and a
   fantasy adventure. You and your friends could collaborate on a project
   – such as building a scale model of the Taj Mahal – or play one of the
   competitive mini-GAME. It’ll keep you occupied for months.

   Fortnite: Battle Royale
   (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, smartphone)
   Still a favourite with teens everywhere, Fortnite: Battle Royale
   thrusts 100 players on to an island and then lets them fight it out to
   see who survives to the end. You can play alone, but the squad mode
   lets you take part in teams of four and it’s usually joyous and
   anarchic. Don’t feel it’s just about fighting either. If you land your
   team somewhere quiet, you can mess about together for ages, building
   forts and sailing boats. There’s also an ingenious creative mode where
   you can build your own levels.

   Sea of Thieves
   (PC, Xbox One)
   This seafaring adventure from veteran developer Rare allows up to four
   friends to clamber aboard a pirate galleon then set sail looking for
   treasure and adventure. You’ll encounter other players as well as
   skeleton ships, islands and quests, and the whole thing is designed to
   get friends working together. It’s utterly enchanting and often
   hilarious.

   Friday 13th
   (Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, Xbox One)
   Star in your own slasher movie with up to seven friends, as teens
   desperately try to escape the murderous clutches of Jason Voorhees. One
   player is randomly selected for each round to play the killer, then
   everyone else has to work together to escape the camp. There are
   numerous weapons and items to discover and side missions to fulfil, and
   it all adds up to a tense, exciting experience. Dead By Daylight offers
   a similar experience with a wider range of monstrous homicidal enemies.

   GTA Online
   (PC, PS4, Xbox One)
   Have you ever thought about what would happen if you and your friends
   tried to rob a bank? Or a casino? This is probably the safest way to
   find out. GTA Online is available when you buy Grand Theft Auto V and
   it allows groups of four friends to plan and execute multi-stage heist
   missions together, all taking on different roles – just like an
   interactive crime movie. At least one of you will need to have played
   the GAME before and reached the appropriate skill level, but playing
   with a mostly amateur and unfamiliar crew offers hours of knockabout
   slapstick fun. For a more sedate experience, Read Dead Online does
   similar things, but with more horses and moseying.

   Don’t Starve Together
   (PC, PS4, Xbox One)
   Okay, the title is pretty grim, but this four-player cooperative
   survival GAME is strangely endearing. The idea is to survive in a
   hostile world as long as possible, gathering natural resources in order
   to make fires, cook food and craft weapons to fight off the extremely
   unfriendly indigenous wildlife. A pretty effective way of discovering
   which of your friends you can rely on in a life-or-death situation.

Mobile GAME – Stuart Dredge

   The paradox of “mobile gaming” is that much of it happens when people
   aren’t mobile at all: they’re sitting on the sofa, lying in bed or
   (caveat: not recommended) perched on the loo. Most of these GAME will
   run happily on a recent (say, from the last three or four years) iPhone
   or Android smartphone, although a couple of them – Sociable Soccer and
   Butter Royale – are iOS-only and part of Apple’s £4.99-a-month Apple
   Arcade subscription.
   Golf Clash
   (iOS/Android)
   Armchair golfers who like to play with friends are well-served on
   mobile: see also Super Stickman Golf 3 and Golf Battle. What I like
   about Golf Clash is partly the rapid-fire matches: if you come up
   against someone much better than you, the pain is over fairly quickly.
   But I also like the sense it gives you of a big community of players
   out there, including your Facebook friends.

   Words With Friends Classic
   (iOS/Android)
   One of the oldest mobile GAME still being actively supported – it was
   first released in 2009 – Words With Friends could be a marvellous tonic
   for anyone in self-isolation. You can have a bunch of its turn-based
   Scrabble-like matches going on at once, including in-GAME chat – and if
   your real-life friends aren’t playing, it’ll match you up with
   strangers.

   Mario Kart Tour
   (iOS/Android)
   This may be a controversial pick: I was as unsure as many people about
   Mario Kart Tour when it first came out for smartphones in September
   2019. Its freemium model wasn’t super-aggressive by mobile standards,
   but it still stuck in the craw for Mario Kart. What’s changed my mind,
   though, is the recent addition of a proper multiplayer mode, including
   friend-matchmaking. It’s still second-best to playing online on a
   Switch or even a 3DS, but if you don’t have those available, this may
   grow on you as it has done on me.
   Clash Royale
   (iOS/Android)
   Now four years old, this is one of the GAME I’ve tended to play
   heavily for a while, then drop out of for a year before firing it up
   again, and spending a week getting royally duffed up while I get to
   grips with all the new features. I’m firing it up again now, though,
   because Clash Royale’s blend of card-collecting/deck-building and
   strategic battles remains magic. But also because its clans system,
   where you can band together with friends for friendly matches and
   card-swapping, is one of the better mobile-GAME recreations of
   real-world networks.

   Pokémon Go
   (iOS/Android)
   Wait a second! A GAME that involves walking lots outside, at a time
   when we may soon be encouraged to stay inside? Stay with me. Developer
   Niantic is making some changes designed to make the GAME fun to play
   even if you’re stuck at home. More beasties will be spawning around
   you, and incense packs (which attract more of them) will be
   super-discounted, and will last for an hour. Meanwhile, another recent
   improvement is the “go battle league” which gets you battling your
   Pokémon against those of other players around the world. If doing it
   from your living room and garden is easier, it wouldn’t surprise me to
   see a big spike in players again.

   Sociable Soccer
   (iOS)
   You can guess a football-loving gamer’s age by whether they go
   misty-eyed at the mention of Sensible Soccer. Some of the team behind
   that series are back together for Sociable Soccer, an Apple Arcade
   exclusive. It’s more than just an homage to Sensi’s wonderful
   pinball-esque gameplay either: there’s an inventive card-based
   team-building system and a meaty 60-hour campaign mode to keep anyone
   busy. Plus there’s a new online multiplayer option, which right now is
   teaching me just how far my standards have slipped since my glory days
   of Sensible Soccer.
   Asphalt 9: Legends
   (iOS/Android)
   Something I gravitated towards for this particular roundup was mobile
   GAME that do more than simply let you play against other people
   online. The latest in Gameloft’s Asphalt racing series is a good
   example: it has a “club” feature where you can create your own driving
   club, add friends, and then challenge one another and run a proper
   league table. Even if you’re playing alone, there’s a decent career
   mode and regular new daily “events” to keep your interest up in this
   fun arcade racer.

   Butter Royale
   (iOS)
   Another Apple Arcade exclusive, this is essentially a top-down Fortnite
   with a dairy obsession. You run around grabbing food-themed weapons and
   splatting other players in 32-person battle royales, or teaming up with
   friends in squads of four. The pitch for a “child-friendly Fortnite”
   will elicit a massive eyeroll from most children (mine, certainly) but
   Butter Royale is great as a casual alternative – especially if you have
   an Apple TV and a compatible joypad handy.
   Kahoot!
   (iOS/Android)
   This isn’t a traditional GAME: it’s a website (and apps) for playing,
   creating and sharing multiple-choice trivia quizzes about… well, about
   pretty much any topic you can think of. Designed to be used by schools
   as well as by parents and children at home, there are subscription
   options but you can do a lot with it for free. In my house we’ve been
   casting a quizmaster’s phone to the TV screen and getting everyone to
   play on their phones, which works really well. Plus – not to tempt fate
   – it could be a genuinely useful tool for parents if and when schools
   in the UK close, and we’re all scrabbling around for good home-learning
   tools.

PC GAME – Jordan Erica Webber

   If you don’t usually play many computer GAME, an easy way to get
   started is to download the hugely popular platform Steam, but you can
   also buy and download GAME straight to your computer from online
   stores such as GOG.com (which has a great collection of classics as
   well as more modern GAME) and itch.io (which specialises in GAME from
   independent creators). You can also use the free voice chat app Discord
   to talk to each other as you play and its screen share feature allows
   you to show each other your screens. Me and my friend, who is stuck out
   in California, have been using this feature to show each other the
   houses we’ve been building in The Sims 4.

   Overcooked! 2
   Windows/Mac (Steam/GOG)
   If you need a good laugh, this is guaranteed to deliver. You and up to
   three others team up to prepare meals for hungry customers: chopping,
   cooking, assembling, delivering, and washing up. Sounds easy, but each
   kitchen features unique and hilarious obstacles, from moving counters
   to collapsing floors.

   Stardew Valley
   Windows/Mac (Steam/GOG)
   A soothing GAME that’ll keep you occupied for dozens of hours. You and
   up to three others run a farm in a small village, carrying out tasks
   together or alone. Activities range from planting crops and caring for
   animals to fighting monsters and courting your favourite villager.

   Tick Tock: A Tale for Two
   Windows/Mac (Steam/itch.io)
   To make the best of a bad situation, try a GAME that is better when
   you’re not in the same place. In Tick Tock: A Tale for Two, you and the
   other player see different versions of the GAME’s mystical world and
   must communicate effectively to solve the puzzles.

   The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan
   Windows (Steam)
   For a remote movie night experience, Man of Medan’s shared story mode
   lets two people play through a horror story together by controlling
   different characters. The story itself isn’t great, but it’ll give you
   something to talk about, and at about four hours long you can play in
   an evening.

   Civilization VI
   Windows/Mac (Steam)
   Want to try your hand at ruling the world? In Civilization VI, you try
   to take your chosen civilization from the Stone Age to the Information
   Age. It looks complex, but there are tutorials for beginners, and it’s
   turn-based, so you can step away from your PC at any time.

   Rocket League
   Windows (Steam)
   Rocket League is football played with rocket cars, easy to learn but
   with plenty of room to develop your skills. With multiple modes for
   different numbers of players, this will easily fit into your schedule.

   Ticket to Ride
   Windows/Mac (Steam/itch.io)
   Board GAME nights are not easily replaced, but we can try. Tabletop
   Simulator is software that lets you play virtual board GAME online,
   but if you want to keep it simple then grab a copy of Ticket to Ride,
   the classic in which you compete to connect cities by rail.

   Diablo III
   PC/Mac (Blizzard)
   Sometimes only mindless button-bashing will do. If you want to run
   around a fantasy land with your friends, taking out hordes of creatures
   with a giant sword or magic spells, levelling up and collecting loot,
   all without having to concentrate too hard, Diablo III is for you.

   Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes
   Windows/Mac (Steam)
   To make your separation part of the GAME, try Keep Talking and Nobody
   Explodes, in which one of you has to defuse a bomb and one has the
   manual, but neither of you can see what the other can. It’s frantic,
   silly, and you only need one copy to play.

   Worms W.M.D.
   Windows/Mac (Steam)
   For a bit of nostalgia, Worms W.M.D. is a more modern-looking
   interpretation of the classic turn-based battle between teams of worms,
   wacky weaponry included, from bazookas to blow torches to banana bombs.
   And with its cartoon violence, it won’t matter if your kids glance over
   at your screen.

Toxicity, Hate and Harassment in Gaming

   Many clients presenting with problematic gaming are likely to have been
   negatively impacted by online toxicity, hate and harassment. In order
   to provide effective treatment for gaming disorder, clinicians need to
   develop cultural humility to understand the darker side of the gaming
   world and how it operates.

   This blog explains that it is not just gaming disorder that needs to be
   addressed by helping professionals but the traumatic toxic experiences
   that clients are exposed to when playing video GAME.

How to identify gaming disorder

   The World Health Organization (WHO) defines gaming disorder as:
     * impaired control over gaming
     * increasing priority given to gaming over other interests and daily
       activities, and
     * continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of
       negative consequences – personal, family, social, educational,
       occupational or other important areas of functioning.

   The WHO states that this pattern of behavior would normally occur over
   a period of at least 12 months in order for a gaming order diagnosis to
   be given. However, if the symptoms are severe enough over a shorter
   period, then a diagnosis can also be considered..

   At INTENTA, we categorize gaming into four stages which we call the
   gaming continuum:
    1. Recreational gaming: About 90% of gamers are casual players for
       whom gaming is a fun activity.
    2. At-risk gaming: About 10% of gamers fall more into the at-risk
       category and have some degree of problematic behavior.
    3. Problematic gaming: About 5% of gamers begin to experience negative
       consequences of their gaming behavior.
    4. Gaming disorder: 1-3% of gamers fall into this category, where
       gaming causes significant impairment in their life. Learn more in
       our article on gaming disorder prevalence.

   If you are a clinician or mental health professional, you may want to
   integrate our gaming disorder screening tools into your practice.

Toxicity in gaming statistics

   Although there are many positive aspects of video GAME – such as
   increased psychological well-being and enhanced cognitive skills – hate
   and harassment are regular occurrences. A 2020 nationally
   representative survey^1 of US gamers aged 18-45 found that:
     * 81% of people who played online multiplayer GAME experienced some
       form of harassment, compared to 74% of gamers in the 2019 survey.
     * 68% of respondents experienced more severe abuse, including
       physical threats, stalking, and sustained harassment, up from 65%
       in 2019. That represents around 45 million online gamers in the US
       reporting significant harassment.
     * The video GAME where players experienced most harassment while
       playing were DOTA 2 (80%), Valorant (80%), Rocket League (76%),
       Grand Theft Auto (76%), Call of Duty (75%) and Counter Strike:
       Global Offensive (75%).
     * 53% of gamers who experienced harassment were targeted because of
       their race/ethnicity, religion, ability status, gender or sexual
       orientation.
     * 41% of female gamers and 37% of LGBTQ gamers were harassed about
       their gender and sexual orientation.
     * 31% of Black gamers and 30% of Hispanic/Latinx gamers experienced
       in-GAME harassment because of their race or ethnicity.
     * 25% of Asian-American gamers experienced harassment based on their
       identity.
     * 25% of disabled gamers were targeted because of their disability.
     * 18% of Jewish gamers and 25% of Muslim gamers said they were
       subjected to harassment.
     * 28% of gamers who experienced harassment avoided certain GAME due
       to their hostile environments.

Why are online GAME so toxic?

   Players sometimes rationalize toxic gaming culture as a normal and
   acceptable part of gaming. Research has shown that toxic behavior is
   contagious^2 among players and exposure in previous GAME increases the
   likelihood that a player will commit toxic acts in future GAME. Also,
   more experienced and skillful players are more likely to engage in
   toxic and abusive behaviors than those who are new to gaming.

How are players being abused online?

   Toxicity in gaming is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Here are
   some of the ways that players are being abused and harassed:

Discrimination

   Players can be discriminated against because of their age, gender,
   ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, religion or spirituality. This
   abuse impacts many individuals who already belong to groups and
   communities that have historically been oppressed and marginalized for
   being their authentic selves.

Swatting

   This occurs when someone is reported to law enforcement for a crime
   they did not commit in the hope that the subsequent police raid is
   broadcast during a live streaming GAME.

Doxing

   Doxing is the act of publicizing a person’s private personal
   information online. It sometimes involves posting their IP address on a
   public forum so that other people who engage in trolling can help to
   crash it.

Flaming

   Flaming (also known as roasting) involves insulting, swearing or using
   other offensive language when gaming to attack a person or group of
   people.

Griefing

   Griefing is deliberately harassing or disrupting the GAME of another
   player within a multiplayer environment. Often this anti-social
   behavior becomes the main goal of the GAME rather than winning. These
   players are known as griefers.

Botting

   Botting involves sending robots to spam another player’s chat stream
   and filling it with hate messages.

Hate raids

   Hate raids occur when people (or robots) flood the chat stream of a
   Twitch streamer and unleash a torrent of abusive language. It is
   distressing for the streamer and for others who are watching.

Hate speech

   This is when abusive language includes racist, sexist or homophobic
   comments, or other hateful and discriminatory behavior.

Online voice chat abuse

   This abuse can be used as a tactic to try to throw someone off their
   GAME. It is similar to tactics sometimes employed in athletic sport but
   it takes on a different level because, unlike athletic sport where
   there are coaches and psychologists to help deal with the consequences,
   when someone is gaming online there is no referee to blow the whistle.

What can players do about online toxicity?

   There are several measures that players can take to avoid online
   toxicity, hate and harassment. These include:
     * Blocking and muting – Players can turn off or mute their in-GAME
       chat and decide if they want to continue with the GAME.
     * Reporting abuse – Most video GAME and gaming platforms have abuse
       reporting procedures.
     * Standing up against toxicity – Family, educators and friends should
       encourage gamers to stand up against online toxicity instead of
       fuelling a bystander culture where in-GAME hate and harassment is
       ignored and normalized.

   The Cybersmile Foundation^3 outlines other coping strategies for
   dealing with online abuse.

Gaming Disorder Clinical Training

   When helping professionals treat clients with gaming disorder it is
   important they understand the cultural context of video GAME. Many
   players presenting with problematic behaviors will have been negatively
   impacted by toxicity, harassment and other online abuse. This can lead
   to trauma which therapists should treat alongside the problematic
   gaming behavior.

Serious GAME for Opening Up Scientific Discovery

   By Elizabeth M H Newbury, V Quidore &amp Ethan Hwang on February 22, 2023

   How can serious GAME be used to contribute to the Year of Open
   Science?

   NASA and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy have
   declared 2023 the “Year of Open Science,” which includes a focus on
   “expanded opportunities for public engagement” (OSTP) with an eye to
   accelerating scientific discovery (NASA).  Open science has the power
   to change the culture of science by not only making research more
   transparent, but also by engaging those who are not traditionally
   involved in the creation and implementation of scientific discovery.

   Broadening engagement is one way of opening up science, and researchers
   have been turning to unique technology to facilitate that type of
   engagement: GAME. As a medium, digital GAME have wide use; the
   Entertainment Software Association estimates that in 2022, over 215
   million people in the United States played video GAME regularly.
   Research institutions have used GAME to not only reach new audiences
   but also speed up scientific research and make scientific discoveries,
   particularly within the field of medical science. As agencies and
   experts look to a Year of Open Science, learning from these
   examples—and looking to the future potentials of GAME supporting
   research—can help level up efforts.

Educational GAME for Leading Research Questions

   To understand how an agency can use GAME, let’s look at two ways of
   implementing GAME. First, institutions can develop a new GAME that is
   framed around a particular research question. GAME can visualize data
   outside the lab, affording not only educational opportunities but
   lowering the barrier of entry to leading research. The National Cancer
   Institute at the National Institutes of Health put on a series in a
   virtual conference called DataViz+Cancer that highlights some key
   considerations in using GAME–and other types of visualizations–in
   research. Two prominent examples illustrate this approach: Foldit and
   Eyewire. Both projects rely on crowd-sourcing data through a GAME to
   help accelerate research.

More About Foldit

   Foldit was created in 2008 as a way to support research in health
   research by crowdsourcing the folding of proteins. The research
   Institutions involved include University of Washington Center for GAME
   Science, University of Washington Institute for Protein Design,
   Northeastern University, Vanderbilt University, University of
   California, Davis, and University of Massachusetts, and Dartmouth.
   Funding for the project comes from both government agencies (including
   DARPA, NSF, and NIH) as well as non-governmental bodies (Microsoft,
   Adobe, Boehringer Ingelheim, RosettaCommons)

   Foldit is a free-to-play puzzle GAME that challenges players to fold
   proteins. In doing so, players contribute to a dataset to help bring
   solutions to diseases like COVID-19, HIV, Alzheimers, and more. It is
   often the example by which GAME-based crowdsourcing projects measure
   themselves, in part due to its success: in less than three weeks in
   2011, participants solved the structure of an HIV-related protein that
   had previously stumped scientists, according to the University of
   Washington.

More about Eyewire

   Eyewire was first launched in 2012 by the Seung Lab with the goal of
   crowdsourcing the analysis of brain neurons and mapping of the brain.
   The research institutions involved include Princeton University,
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Max Planck Institute for
   Medical Research. Additionally, funding for the project comes from both
   government agencies (including IARPA, NSF, and NIH) and
   non-governmental bodies (the Max Planck Society, the Howard Hughes
   Medical Institute, AWS, KT, and Gatsby Charitable Foundation).

   In a similar vein, the Seung Lab at Princeton University developed
   Eyewire as part of a quest to map the some 100 trillion connections
   between neurons in the human brain. Players reconstruct a neuron’s 3D
   structure from 2D cross sections, making connections that AI would
   miss. The community’s work improves computational technologies with the
   hopes of one day finding a cure for neurological disorders caused by
   miswired neurons. As reported in Nature, so far Eyewire players have
   reconstructed parts of retinal neurons, leading to breakthroughs in how
   neuroscientists understand the mechanisms underlying motion perception.

   These GAME illustrate that for crowdsourcing, data needs to be not
   only fun for users to engage with, but also easily digestible and
   distributed. Importantly, the tasks are manageable. The GAME break
   down an overall research question into small, bite-sized problem sets
   with a finite task and focused data sets. Breaking down the data and
   distributing the task across thousands of computers ultimately enables
   massive participation.

   But what makes it a GAME is the employment of play–and competition–that
   everyone from researchers to science educators appreciate. In both
   instances the data becomes a “puzzle” for players to solve that are
   just a few steps beyond Wordle. These puzzles vary in complexity, but a
   sense of achievement is extrinsically motivated through a reward
   system.  In Foldit, there are arcade-style leaderboards and monthly
   challenges, and Eyewire regularly holds special events where players
   can compete in teams or race to trace an entire cell within 24 hours.
   These mechanics not only motivate individuals, but in creating these
   forms of visible competition go one step further in developing a sense
   of community around the GAME that is so vital to long-term
   participation.

Commercial GAME Companies Collaborating with Research Institutions

   In addition to creating their own GAME, there is a growing interest in
   how researchers can also work with commercial GAME companies to engage
   existing audiences. An example of this is the collaboration around EVE
   Online. EVE Online is a massive multiplayer online roleplaying GAME
   that is perhaps best known for corporate espionage and heistsin a
   space-themed environment.According to a report from GAMEBeat in 2021,
   it boasts a unique user base of 25 million globally with approximately
   300,000-400,000 players concurrently. It is a commercial GAME that has
   opened its doors to crowdsourcing scientific research through themed
   content embedded in the GAME itself under a mini-GAME called “Project
   Discovery.”

More About EVE Online Project Discovery

   The original EVE Online launched in 2003 as a space-based MMO, while
   Project Discovery, the citizen science project, originally launched as
   a mini-GAME within the GAME in 2016. Partners for the latest project,
   focusing on support for COVID-19, included McGill University, BD,
   Beckman Coulter, FlowJo, BC Cancer, Massively Multiplayer Online
   Science, and CCP GAME (the studio that makes EVE Online), and the
   project was supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and
   innovation programme.

   In “Project Discovery,” players have been tasked with supporting
   projects from discovering exoplanets (as above) to supporting the Human
   Protein Atlas (HPA), which aims to map proteins within human cells by
   cataloging different cell structures in over 250,000 images. In a
   recent version of the mini-GAME, players mapped flow cytometry by
   creating polygons around cells to help scientists understand immune
   response to COVID-19. By crowdsourcing this within EVE Online, as
   reported in IGN, it amounted to 1.37 million points of data which, in
   turn, the team estimated saved scientists 330 years of work in
   researching COVID-19.

   There are a few things that were attributed to this success. First,
   while an innovative mini-GAME, “Project Discovery” fits within the
   overall feel of the GAME, with mechanics similar to other in-GAME
   tasks. But this mini-GAME also hits home on a nuanced way of
   understanding player motivation: it isn’t just about in-GAME rewards.
   In the same report from IGN, EVE Online Creative Director, Bergur
   Finnbogason pointed out three primary player types: those playing for
   in-GAME rewards, those playing because they were already deeply
   invested in EVE Online, and those playing for science.

   While a qualitative observation, studies have time and again
   demonstrated that motivation for GAME players is varied. Those wishing
   to capitalize on GAME as a way to build out scientific research should
   consider multiple ways of incentivizing participation. While in-GAME
   rewards most certainly help, some players will be motivated because it
   affords them an opportunity to deepen their engagement with the GAME
   and its story; others because it allows them to explore something new,
   like a fresh mechanic; and still others because it connects them to a
   broader community effort, scientific or otherwise.

What’s Next?

   These examples highlight ways that GAME have fostered the acceleration
   of scientific research while also expanding the scope of contributors
   to that research. In the case of Foldit and Eyewire, researchers
   leveraged GAME elements to make science more engaging and build a
   community that has made real-world impacts. In the case of EVE Online,
   an already popular GAME title was used to crowdsource data for health
   research. In both cases the research teams distributed the data to not
   only make it more adaptable for broad use, but transform it into a
   playful experience through puzzles and GAME mechanics. The key is to
   recognize both the broad possibilities of GAME and the diverse
   motivations and objectives of their players. Just like with any other
   medium, people play video GAME for a variety of reasons that can be
   tapped into to increase scientific engagement. Some gamers value points
   and in-GAME rewards while others seek opportunities to explore new
   horizons in the GAME or deepen their play. Some prefer supporting a
   broader community, while others relish competition. What’s also
   important to know is that, at least in these cases, they can also
   ultimately support scientific discovery.

   The best legit money making apps can provide you with extra money you
   would not have otherwise just for takings surveys or playing GAME
   online.

   The web’s #1 top app for taking surveys, watching videos, and playing
   GAME for cash online is Swagbucks. It’s a well-built platform that is
   well-reviewed, and widely available for Android, iOS, and through your
   internet browser.

Overview: Best apps to make money fast

     * Best app for fast money: Swagbucks
     * Best variety of GAME &amp surveys: InboxDollars
     * Best for shopping rewards: Capital One Shopping
     * See more apps; read about the competition

Swagbucks

   People love Swagbucks because it’s a money making app that you can use
   anywhere, on your own schedule, to earn gift cards or cash rewards
   straight to your PayPal account.
   Swagbucks Swagbucks
   Swagbucks

   Swagbucks is perhaps the web’s no. 1 venue for taking surveys, watching
   videos, and playing GAME for cash online. The platform is well-built,
   well-reviewed, and available for Android, iOS, and through your
   internet browser.
   Offer: Get a $10 Bonus*!
   Pros:
     * Earn cashback with your daily routine
     * Multiple ways to earn
     * Free to join

   Cons:
     * May not qualify for all activities
     * Can be time consuming

   Sign Up Now
     * Where to play: Android, iOS, and swagbucks.com
     * Typical payout: ~$2–$3 per hour.
     * Cost to play: Free (most GAME)
     * Payout method: Gift cards via email, cash via PayPal

   Upon arriving at Swagbucks’ GAME hub, you’ll notice that some GAME
   offer cash and some offer cash back. It’s worth clarifying that if you
   play popular GAME like Trivial Pursuit and Bejeweled 2 through
   Swagbucks you won’t get paid, but SB will offer you a small rebate for
   cash you spend inside the GAME.

   In the second category, Swagbucks will actually pay you in cash or gift
   cards to play certain GAME. Some are recognizable, like Forge of
   Empires and Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire. Since you’re effectively
   playtesting these GAME for developers, Swagbucks will pay you the
   equivalent of ~$2 per hour in points, which can be redeemed once you
   earn around $5 for a gift card or money into your PayPal account.

   Swagbucks’ competitive advantage is the variety of non-GAME activities.
   As you accumulate points towards your next payout threshold, you can
   take a break from GAME and watch videos, take surveys, and more.

InboxDollars

   InboxDollars is a money making app offering surveys, videos, and of
   course, GAME as ways to earn a few cents to a few bucks per hour, all
   on your own schedule.
   InboxDollars InboxDollars
   InboxDollars

   InboxDollars is a free app that offers a variety of ways to make money
   fast including surveys that pay between $0.50 and $5, earning cash back
   for playing GAME. You can even get paid for receiving and reading
   certain emails.
   Offer: Get an instant $5 Welcome Bonus for registering today!
   Pros:
     * Earn cash, not points
     * Totally free; no risk to sign up

   Cons:
     * Not everyone will qualify for highest-paid surveys

   Create Free Account
     * Pros: Variety of GAME
     * Cons: Average earnings
     * Where to play: Android and inboxdollars.com
     * Typical payout: $1–$2 per hour
     * Cost to play: Free
     * Payout method: Gift cards via email, cash via PayPal

   Available as a site and Android app (the iOS app is for surveys only),
   InboxDollars makes up for below-average payout amounts with a sheer
   variety of GAME to play. Their extensive library includes classics
   like solitaire, mahjong, and sudoku, but also new mobile GAME in need
   of testing.

   If you’re already addicted to simple browser and mobile GAME like the
   ones listed above, InboxDollars might be a no-brainer. You won’t make a
   ton of money by only playing for an hour or two a day, but it adds up
   fast.

   Plus, if you tire of GAME, you can also switch over to watching videos
   or survey-taking as ways to accumulate InboxDollars on your way to
   their $30 minimum threshold. It’ll take a while, but at least you’ll
   have plenty of ways to get there. Enjoy a $5 sign up bonus when you
   enroll.

The competition

   Here are some more of the best money making apps we recommend that just
   didn’t make our top three. All of these apps are legit and can save
   money or make money with relatively little effort. These other apps pay
   either in PayPal cash, free gift card or, in a few cases, direct
   deposit to. your bank account.

Mistplay

   Mistplay pays you to play new Android GAME and provides developers
   with feedback based upon your experience. Each 2- to 10-minute gaming
   session can reward the cash equivalent of $0.66.
     * Pros: Curates based upon your gaming preferences
     * Cons: Only available on Android
     * Where to play: Android
     * Typical payout: $2–$5 per hour
     * Cost to play: Free
     * Payout method: Gift cards via email (within 48 hours), including
       Visa, Amazon, Steam, and more

   Mistplay pays out a little above average, and I admire the platform for
   being both developer- and user-friendly. First, to benefit developers
   who test their GAME through Mistplay, the app accelerates cash
   earnings the longer you test a GAME, so you’re incentivized to play
   longer and provide better feedback to its creators. Second, Mistplay
   offers users a feature called the “Mix” whereby it’ll generate a
   playlist of gaming experiences based upon your genre preferences
   (puzzle, platforming, action, etc.).

   In total, Mistplay is a great place for gamers to test new GAME and
   help out developers while earning a trickle of cash for their efforts.
   As far as GAME-for-cash sites go, Mistplay seems among the most
   wholesome and well-intentioned.

   » Sign Up for Mistplay.

   We investigated around three dozen popular GAME-for-cash sites. These
   don’t make our top picks but still stood out as great options to
   consider.

Truist Long GAME

   Truist Long GAME is best described as a gamified savings account. When
   you make a deposit into your Long GAME account, whether automatic or
   manual, Long GAME will reward you for saving by giving you coins that
   you can use to play GAME.
     * Pros: Can incentivize more saving, potential jackpots can offset
       lower APY
     * Cons: Low base APY may apply
     * Where to play: Android and iOS
     * Typical payout: APY plus jackpots ranging from $100 to $1,000,000
     * Cost to play: Free for 30 days, then $3 monthly (waived if you set
       up automatic savings)
     * Payout method: Direct deposit into savings

   Founded by a California-based Millennial looking to inspire young
   people to save, Long GAME offers a free 30-day trial and stays free as
   long as you use direct deposit. What’s also nice is that all of your
   money is FDIC-insured.

   Long GAME might be a good fit if the lure of getting more coins to play
   GAME incentivizes you to save more in the long run.

Rakuten

   You won’t get paid $2 an hour to play Angry Birds 2 with Rakuten — but
   several folks told me they switched from gaming apps to Rakuten because
   the savings outweighed the income generation from gaming.
     * Pros: Constantly changing deals to suit your shopping tastes
     * Cons: May tempt you to spend money
     * Where to play: Android and iOS
     * Typical payout: Up to 10% off at over 3,500 retailers
     * Cost to play: Free
     * Payout method: Delayed cash back on purchases

   And to Rakuten’s credit, the app does kinda “gamify” shopping.

   Here’s how Rakuten (Japanese for “optimism”) works. If you’re on the
   way to the store, instead of a gaming app, crack open Rakuten and see
   what exclusive deals the retailer is currently offering through
   Rakuten. Link the credit card you’re about to use at the register,
   swipe it to pay, and Rakuten automatically registers that you’ve earned
   the reward.

   In total, Rakuten claims to have saved shoppers over $3.5 billion in
   cash back from over 3,500 retailers. And the deals constantly change
   with the tide, which makes it kinda fun.

   Just be careful not to let Rakuten convince you to spend money you’d
   otherwise be saving!

   » Sign Up for Rakuten.

Survey Junkie

   Survey Junkie is a long-established free app that helps you make money
   and earn rewards while taking online surveys on your own hours. Earning
   money with Survey Junkie is as easy as signing up, completing your
   profile, and then completing market research surveys that come your
   way.

   How much you can earn with Survey Junkie really depends on the number
   of market research online surveys you’re selected for. It’s not passive
   income, but it’s another easy way to pick up some extra cash.

Google Opinion Rewards

   Yep, the Google. They have a paid survey app and, as you can imagine,
   it’s pretty well-made. It’s a top choice if you’re looking to get paid
   to share your thoughts.
     * Pros: Positive reviews and stable app
     * Cons: Sometimes limited surveys
     * Where to play: Android and iOS
     * Typical payout: $4–$5 per hour (when surveys are available)
     * Cost to play: Free
     * Payout method: PayPal or Play Store credit

   Here’s how Google describes it. “Complete short surveys while standing
   in line, or waiting for a subway. Get rewarded with Google Play or
   PayPal credit for each one you complete.”

   The app maintains a 4.7 out of 5 stars in the Play Store and the
   positive reviews seem legit. Folks complain about the occasional
   shortage of surveys to take, sure, but they still seem to earn enough
   cash overall to cover one premium subscription each month (e.g.,
   YouTube Premium for $11.99).

   The app deserves kudos for overall stability, too, since paid survey
   apps tend to crash frequently and cause frustration.

Other money making apps to avoid

   Honorable mention to some other great free apps out there that may
   branch out the realm of earning with surveys and GAME. These include
   Survey Junkie, Ibotta, Fiverr, Upwork, and OfferUp. They’re worth
   checking out.

   Here, though, are three that aren’t. Out of the dozens of apps I
   investigated, I’m shining a spotlight on this ignominious trifecta
   because their shadiness was the most well-hidden. These three sites and
   apps appear legit at first, but there’s something more mischievous,
   even sinister underneath their facades.

Bananatic

   No single violation disqualified Bananatic from this list. Rather, it
   was more of a “death by 1,000 cuts” situation, since everywhere I
   looked I got an uneasy vibe from this site.

   Everything about Bananatic looks legit at first glance. According to
   Similar Web, the site has over a quarter-million visitors per month
   plus a similar number of Likes on Facebook, and the BananApp (as it’s
   called) received plenty of five-star reviews on the Play Store. Plus,
   the site itself looks pretty legit and well-designed, almost like a
   rival to Steam.

   However, the plot thickens as I pulled back the curtain. Despite having
   256,000 Facebook Likes, nobody engages with their content, posted at
   precisely 9 AM every four days. Many of their five-star reviews on the
   Play Store sound fake, and when a real human publishes a legit one-star
   review, Bananatic responds “Please change or delete your opinion.”

Givling

   Givling was the last GAME-for-cash site to be ejected from my final
   list. It wasn’t easy, because I cheered for Givling. I wanted the app
   to be as good as it sounded.

   See, the problem with Givling is that you can’t just log in tomorrow,
   win the week’s trivia, and receive the jackpot. Everything you do in
   Givling raises your place in the “queue,” and whoever’s at the top of
   the queue every two weeks gets the jackpot.

   You can rise up the queue by watching ads and playing GAME, but also
   by buying products from Givling’s sponsors and simply handing the app
   money.

   Do you see the problem? You essentially have to “bid” your way to the
   top, which explains why one woman had to spend $42,000 to win $50,000
   (and countless players spend thousands for nothing).

   Inevitably, in 2019 Givling got blasted by CNBC for manipulating and
   frisking players who were simply desperate to pay off their student
   loans. A Minnesota state legislator called it “gambling” while watchdog
   group Pyramid Scheme Alert called it “a sophisticated scheme.”

Lucky Day

   Lucky Day was endorsed by so many “Top 10 GAME-For-Cash Sites”
   listicles that I assumed it must have some air of legitimacy.
   Furthermore, it offered a simple, seemingly incorruptible premise: play
   free virtual scratch-offs, maybe win some cash.

   Even still, the app had a rather nasty trick up its sleeve, one that I
   alluded to earlier.

   Lucky Day has a payout threshold of $10. When you collect enough
   points, you’re supposed to head to the in-app marketplace to exchange
   your points for a gift card. However, users are reporting that once
   they reach about $9.90 worth of points, they never seem to win the last
   $0.10 despite weeks, months, even years of attempts.

   Once you approach the threshold, the app pushes paid “upgrades” that
   supposedly increase your chances of earning those final $0.10 so you
   can finally cash out. Users spend $1, $3, then $5 on upgrades but still
   don’t win the final $0.10.

Tip

Most GAME-for-cash sites are a waste of time at best and can fleece you out of
thousands at worst. If you’re really interested in experimenting with this type
of website, you’ll find safer havens in the options that I’ve highlighted.

How we came up with this list

   To create this list I investigated about three dozen of the most
   popular GAME-for-cash sites and apps. I graded each using a rubric
   combining multiple factors:
     * Legitimacy — Is the app what it claims to be, or is it stealing
       data?
     * Usability — Does the app work and is it regularly updated and
       supported?
     * User reviews — Is the quality and legitimacy of the app verified by
       real user reviews?
     * Cash payout — Do users report actually receiving cash or free gift
       cards from the app?
     * Variety and quality of GAME — Quite simply, are the GAME fun and
       varied?

   To my surprise, even some of the most popular GAME-for-cash apps
   failed stupendously in two of the most critical metrics: user reviews
   and cash payout.

   Many GAME-for-cash apps have glowing App Store reviews that are
   clearly fake and paid for. This really bothers me, because it means
   that rather than listen to their critical user feedback, developers
   chose instead to spend resources drowning them out so they could lure
   more users into broken apps. Fake review scores mean a developer
   doesn’t care and neither should you.

   Next, some of the more popular GAME-for-cash apps have developed an
   insidious scheme whereby they cut off earnings just short of their
   payout threshold. For example, one app has a $10 minimum payout amount,
   which sounds easy to reach, but right as users approached $9.85 in
   credit, earning opportunities mysteriously dried up.

   As a result, users stuck in a sunk-cost fallacy would continue to log
   in for weeks and months, digging through ads for opportunities that
   didn’t exist. Basically, the app had duped them into hours of free
   labor, and naturally, had no place on this list.

Who the best apps to make money are for

   These apps for are people looking to make extra income and earn rewards
   by completing activities they would have anyway while earning cashback
   or branching out with surveys and GAME. They’re not for people looking
   to generate life-changing amounts of money.

How to spot a sketchy paid gaming app

   Now that we’ve covered some legit and less-legit cash-generating apps,
   what red flags should you watch out for to separate the two?

   Let’s use the weirdest, sketchiest one I came across as an ignominious
   example: Coin Pop.

   For starters, Coin Pop is an Android-only app, not to be mistaken for
   COIN POP — Covered in Kitties listed on the App Store.

   Anyways, despite having the less interesting name of the two, Coin Pop
   for Android is one quirky gaming app. On the surface it’s pretty
   standard stuff: play GAME, reach “levels,” convert level bonuses to
   cash.

   But things get weird from there.

   First, once you register, Coin Pop will ask your age and gender so it
   can offer you a preselected list of what it thinks are age- and
   gender-specific GAME (Coin Pop isn’t gunning for Politically Correct
   App of the Year).

   Then, Coin Pop will prompt you to download GAME you’d like to play
   individually. This can take up some serious space on your hard drive,
   and since the ROI on certain GAME tends to drop off a cliff after a
   few sessions, you’re encouraged to keep downloading new GAME
   constantly and sucking up your data.

   Worse still, the app used to let you cash out as little as $0.50 worth
   of earnings, and securely via PayPal, no less.

   But now, Coin Pop has moved the goalpost to $35 — and even the most
   dedicated users report it being impossible to get there. Multiple users
   have reported getting super close, only to be logged out and unable to
   log back in.

   But I love Coin Pop because it’s a one-stop-shop for every red flag in
   the paid gaming space. A jack-of-all-trades of shadiness, if you will.

   Those red flags are:
     * Requires a concerning amount of personal data upfront (e.g., facial
       ID)
     * Uses too much mobile data
     * Appears to be “abandonware” with little to no developer support
     * A confusing rewards system
     * A manipulative and unreachable cashing out threshold
     * Overwhelmingly negative app reviews
     * A disconnect between anonymous rating scores and published review
       scores
     * Doesn’t tell you when you’re not earning cash to trick you into
       playing “for free”

   Here are some other paid gaming apps that raised at least two of these
   red flags:
     * Poll Pay
     * App Flame
     * Money Well
     * Bingo Clash
     * Match2Win
     * CashAlarm
     * Money RAWR
     * Cashyy

   Can the developers turn these apps around? Possibly. But for now, I
   subjectively think they’re a waste of time.

Why do GAME apps let you play for money?

   When you play GAME through apps like Swagbucks, Mistplay, or
   InboxDollars, they’re paying you because you’re watching ads or testing
   GAME for their clients, the developers.

   In essence, you’re every child’s dream: a paid video GAME tester. Even
   if you’re not directly providing feedback via surveys, the developers
   are collecting background data like how long it took you to complete a
   certain quest, where you got lost, which items you used, etc. This is
   incredibly valuable data to mobile GAME developers, especially since
   they’re competing to make the most playable and addictive GAME
   possible.

How much money can you make playing GAME online?

   Payouts from GAME-for-cash sites and apps can range from a few cents
   per hour to an entire $50,000 jackpot.

   On average, you can consistently make around $2 per hour playing GAME
   online.

   Overall, GAME-for-cash sites aren’t much of an income generator, so I
   don’t recommend that you play them for the money. Instead, play them
   for fun and enjoy the trickle of cash as a side bonus.

Is my personal information safe on these websites?

   Sharing your name, email, and phone number online is never totally
   risk-free, but generally speaking, you’ll be OK sharing the bare
   essentials on these sites.

   In some cases, these sites may redirect you to third-party apps or
   GAME. If so, follow these tips to protect your personal information,
   and don’t hesitate to back out if you feel uncomfortable:
     * Add your phone number to the Do Not Call Registry
     * Use an alternative email address
     * Give a fake phone number (XXX-555-XXXX)
     * Use your last initial instead of your full name
     * Never give possible answers to “secret questions” i.e., name of
       childhood best friend

Summary: Best apps to make money fast

   “Play GAME for cash” sounds too good to be true, and it mostly is. The
   majority of GAME-for-cash sites are junk, luring users in with fake
   review scores and teasing them with cash payouts that will never come.

   However, there are at least six that are honest and well-intentioned,
   including our top pick, Swagbucks. These apps can be good options that
   pay money and are honest, legitimate, and maybe even worthy of your
   time.

   life-changing money, check out our list of the Best Budgeting Apps.

Rules

     It is a basic paradox of GAME that while the rules themselves are
     generally definite, unambiguous, and easy to use, the enjoyment of a
     GAME depends on these easy to use rules presenting challenges that
     cannot be easily overcome.
     — Jesper Juul

   GAME are structured activities that are governed by a set of rules.
   The rules of a GAME define how the GAME is played, what actions are
   allowed or prohibited, and how players should behave. They provide a
   framework for the GAME and help to ensure that it is fair and enjoyable
   for all players.

   Rules are an integral part of GAME, and they serve a variety of
   purposes. One of the main purposes of rules is to establish a level
   playing field for all players. By defining the parameters of the GAME,
   rules help to ensure that everyone is playing by the same set of rules
   and that no one has an unfair advantage. Rules can also help to make
   GAME more predictable and strategic, as players can plan their moves
   based on a clear understanding of what is and is not allowed.

   Additionally, rules can help to create a sense of structure and order
   in GAME, which can make them more enjoyable and satisfying to play.
   Finally, rules can help to promote sportsmanship and good behavior in
   GAME, as they define how players should interact with each other and
   how they should behave.

   In one sense, rules in GAME are completely arbitrary, because they can
   be anything we make up. But in another sense, they are not arbitrary,
   in the sense that they are not chosen randomly or without purpose, and
   we must obey them in order to play the GAME properly. Rather, the rules
   of a GAME are typically carefully designed to create a specific type of
   gameplay experience and to achieve specific goals or objectives.

   For example, the rules of a board GAME might be designed to create a
   balance between strategy and luck, to make the GAME challenging but
   also fair for all players. The rules of a video GAME might be designed
   to create a sense of immersion and to make the GAME more realistic or
   believable.

   In some cases, the rules of a GAME may be modified or altered in order
   to achieve a specific goal or to make the GAME more enjoyable. However,
   even in these cases, the changes to the rules are generally not
   arbitrary, but rather are made with a specific purpose in mind.

   Creating a set of rules requires you to mentally switch back and forth
   between the GAME’s rule framework and the experience that will be
   provided to the followers, er, I mean players, of your rule set. When
   creating rules and GAME, you’ll frequently think in diagrammatic
   languages, whereas what the players experience is not your wireframes
   and logic flows, but a world of images, sounds, spaces and objects to
   do things with.

Kinds of Rules

   The three types of rules that Bernard Suits describes in The
   Grasshopper are the rules of skill, rules of transgression, and
   constitutive rules.

   Constitutive Rules are what count as legal and fair in the GAME. Any
   attempt to circumvent these restrictions is dishonest.

   A Rule of Infraction, like an offsides call or a foul ball, are an
   integral aspect of the GAME. Strategic infractions include the
   intentional fouling of an opponent for tactical or time-buying purposes
   (like with personal fouls in basketball). GAME, however, wouldn’t
   normally permit players to cheat or otherwise violate the laws of the
   GAME.

   The Rules of Skill are recommendations rather than mandates about how
   to play the GAME. For instance, it’s illogical to allow players to
   score against themselves (perform own-goals), but it is often possible
   to do so nonetheless.

   Skill rules are typically implicit but constitutive and violation rules
   are explicitly stated.

Mechanics

   A GAME mechanic is a specific rule or set of rules that defines how a
   GAME functions and how players interact with it. GAME mechanics are an
   essential part of GAME design and can have a major impact on the
   gameplay experience.

   There are many different types of GAME mechanics, and they can vary
   widely depending on the type of GAME. Some common examples of GAME
   mechanics include:

   Resource management: This involves managing and using resources, such
   as money or resources in a GAME, in order to achieve a goal.

   Chance: This involves using elements of chance, such as dice rolls or
   shuffled decks of cards, to determine the outcome of events in a GAME.

   Strategy: This involves making strategic decisions and planning ahead
   in order to achieve a goal.

   Competition: This involves competing against other players or teams in
   order to win.

   Cooperation: This involves working together with other players or teams
   in order to achieve a shared goal.

   Role-playing: This involves assuming the role of a specific character
   or persona and acting out that role within the context of the GAME.

   Whereas computer GAME systems can readily hide their mechanisms which
   have to be uncovered through interaction, board GAME nearly always
   have their mechanics laid bare for the player in the rulebook.
   Everything that occurs between the first few turns and someone winning
   the GAME is categorizable as a GAME mechanic.

   The GAME’s mechanics can alter the GAME state, the options available to
   players, and even other GAME mechanics. The mechanics of a GAME can
   either be predetermined by the system or determined by the players
   themselves. If a mechanic leaves no room for player agency, then that
   mechanic is system-driven, which is more common in video GAME than in
   board GAME, since the latter tend to put the onus of all
   decision-making on the players themselves.

   The mechanics of video GAME are frequently easy to figure out by
   observation and experimentation; in many cases, you don’t even need to
   read the manual before getting started. This is where mobile GAME can
   be particularly engaging: the small screen gives the player only a
   limited amount of room to move their thumb and eyes over the screen.
   Rules aren’t always necessary in mobile GAME because players have so
   few options on how to interact with the GAME.

   We should probably define GAME mechanics more formally now:

     GAME mechanics are methods invoked by agents for interacting with
     the GAME world. (“Defining GAME Mechanics,” GAMEtudies.org)

   Actions in a GAME require mechanics, such as the ability to roll dice,
   leap, battle, push buttons, take turns, etc. Mechanics can also be
   thought of as a system of rules designed to achieve a specific goal.
   Mechanics typically mirror actions we are quite familiar with in the
   actual world, such as sprinting or kicking a ball around. There is a
   great deal of implicit embodied knowledge regarding the physics of
   these kinds of activities that we can draw upon.

   However, since computer graphics frequently adopts animation
   aesthetics, we shouldn’t be surprised if real-world physics is often
   distorted in digital GAME, for aesthetic and experiential effect;
   animation in film has always relied on highly exaggerated movements
   because the goal is typically not to faithfully represent natural
   phenomena but rather to express something more human and emotional, and
   this practice continues with video GAME.

   Card GAME have entertained people for centuries and have always been a
   great way to pass time. They're social, portable and inexpensive
   (unless you're gambling with money), and the rules are easy to learn.
   For me, card GAME were integral to my childhood: I grew up playing
   cards with my parents and three siblings. I was six years old when I
   played my first card in a GAME of Crazy Eights, and I've dealt
   countless hands since then.

   I'm passionate about a wide variety of GAME, whether they be board,
   tabletop or card GAME, and the ones listed here are what I've played
   most often and that bring back the best memories. If you decide to play
   them, I hope they serve you similarly well. They range from the
   straightforward to the complex, and all can be played with a standard
   52-card deck.

Card GAME for 2 people

   Most multiplayer card GAME can be scaled up or down to accommodate
   more or fewer players and the GAME mentioned here are no exception.
   There are variations for three people, but they're at their best when
   you play with just two.

   500 Rummy

   This is one of my favourite GAME because it doesn't take long to play;
   the rules are simple; and there's the dramatic possibility of starting
   out badly, but ultimately winning the GAME, and vice versa. It belongs
   to the rummy family of card GAME, which involve grouping cards
   together in certain sequences and sets. The objective is to be the
   first player to score 500 points.

   To score points, you must play sets of a minimum of three cards that
   are the same rank (e.g. three sevens) or a run of cards in a sequence
   of the same suit (e.g. 10, jack, queen of spades).

   The GAME is played in rounds, which end when one player has no cards
   left in their hand. The catch is if you still have cards in your hand
   at the end of the round, the value of those cards is deducted from your
   score.

   In my experience, there are two main strategies: aim to end the round
   early to catch the other player(s) out with a lot of cards in their
   hand; or try to make the round last as long as possible so you have
   more opportunities to pick up cards and score points.

   The drawback of the first strategy is it's often difficult to score
   high in a short round, even if you don't have to subtract anything. The
   drawback of the second tactic is you have to pick up cards to score
   high, and if another player ends the round, you may suffer a hefty
   penalty. You can vary your strategy from round to round depending on
   which cards you're dealt.

   How to play 500 Rummy

   Cribbage

   Even if you've never played cribbage before, you might know it involves
   a board to keep score. I love the board because it's such an iconic
   part of the GAME, but you don't have to have one to play. There have
   been times when I haven't had a board nearby, and I've kept score with
   pen and paper.

   The objective is to score either 61 or 121 points (you can play to
   either total), earned by forming groups of two or more cards of the
   same value, runs, and card combinations that add up to 15. The running
   total can't exceed 31 during play. It's a quirky GAME with three phases
   in which you can score points, but it's not nearly as complicated as it
   sounds.

   When the cards are dealt, each player gets six cards and must discard
   two, which go into the crib — the extra hand from which the dealer can
   score points.

   Cribbage is the perfect balance of strategy and luck. With the discard
   rule at the start of the GAME, you have to determine your strategy
   before you know whether you'll be able to execute it. There is also a
   random card which is turned face up and which both players may count as
   part of their hand. So you can choose what to discard in the hope that
   a particular card will turn up.

   The play ends the moment either player reaches the agreed total,
   whether by pegging or counting their hand.

   How to play cribbage

The best old favourites

   These beloved classics are often played long into the night and are
   staples of veteran card tables. These GAME have endured particularly
   well because they're among the most social of card GAME and have
   become a part of pop culture through films, television and gaming.

   Euchre

   Popular in parts of Canada — especially Ontario — euchre is a
   trick-taking GAME for four people on two teams (though there are
   variations for between two and eight players). For a card GAME that
   forbids table talk, it's a surprisingly social GAME. The better you
   know your partner, the better your chances of winning. Trust in your
   partner is vital and as important as strategy.

   The objective is to win at least three tricks, with a bonus for winning
   all five. This is done by playing the highest-ranking card in a round.
   In euchre, a trump suit is called, which means all cards of that suit,
   plus the jack of the suit of the same colour, become the
   highest-ranking cards.

   The trick here (pun intended!) is to trust that your partner knows what
   they are doing. If your partner plays an ace, for example, they're
   likely to win the trick for your team. So if you have a card higher
   than an ace, it's likely a waste to play it because your partner is
   likely to win the trick. You can save that strong card for another
   trick later.

   How to play euchre

   Poker

   Poker is so ingrained in our culture, most people have heard of it.
   Admittedly, I had never read the rules before playing; I learned how to
   play solely by watching James Bond films. It got me so far as winning
   $62 US at a casino once, which I promptly lost the following round.

   Poker can be every bit as dramatic as it is in the movies. And there's
   something in it for everyone — from the strategist who calculates the
   odds meticulously to the observer who can tell which players are
   bluffing.

   The objective in poker is to win money (or chips, which may or may not
   represent money). You do this either by forming the best five-card hand
   at the table or bluffing your way to victory with a lower-ranking hand
   and persuading other players to fold. Depending on whether you're
   playing at home or in a casino, the GAME can be as serious or as casual
   as you like.

   If you've never played poker, I highly recommend giving it a shot just
   so you can have the experience. You can bet it'll be memorable.

   How to play poker

   Hearts

   Like euchre, hearts is a trick-taking GAME. However, the objective is
   to take the fewest number of tricks and avoid scoring points. For this
   reason, it is known as a GAME of evasion. Three or more players may
   gather round a table for hearts, but it's most often played with four
   people.

   All the cards are dealt, and each heart scores one point, with the
   queen of spades scoring 13 points. It's a common strategy to lead with
   a low-ranking spade after the first trick to draw the queen out. The
   GAME ends when one player scores 100 points or more. All players tally
   up their points, and the person with the fewest wins.

   If you're feeling ambitious, you may try to "shoot the moon," which is
   when you win all 13 hearts plus the queen of spades. In this case, your
   score is reduced by 26 points or you can choose to increase the scores
   of all other players by 26 points.

   Hearts came with an early version of Microsoft Windows in 1992 and was
   included in every version of the program up to Windows XP and ME.

   How to play hearts

The best GAME to play as a family

   Card GAME are a great way to support your kids' arithmetic and
   strategy skills — but fun comes first. Many are suitable for children,
   but don't think that adults can't enjoy them too. Try some of these as
   a family, and you'll have your kids begging to do math without
   realizing it.

   Cheat (I Doubt It)

   Cheat is a lot of fun, especially if you have children who delight in
   mischief. I might be part of the generation who learned it first
   through the gaming site Neopets.com, but I have played my fair share of
   offline Cheat too. It's a highly satisfying GAME because there's
   nothing like knowing another player is cheating because you have the
   cards they claim to have.

   The objective is to get rid of all your cards by taking turns playing
   them in sequence. The fun part is you can try to discard more cards
   than the rules allow by pretending that your two threes are actually
   two sevens — if you can't play your threes when it's time to discard,
   for example.

   Children and adults alike will enjoy getting away with cheating and
   catching other players cheating.

   How to play Cheat

   Fan Tan

   This is a GAME that my family used to close out card GAME night because
   it inherently reorders the deck and leaves it ready to be shuffled
   again for the next GAME night. It's straightforward: the objective is
   to get rid of all the cards in your hand by playing them in sequence.

   Since a seven starts a row for a suit, you can annoy other players who
   have cards of that suit by holding onto your seven.

   How to play Fan Tan

    99

   This GAME is fast-paced and requires quick mental addition. Certain
   cards have designated values and actions, which can be written down on
   a cheat sheet for reference.

   The objective is to play your cards without taking the value of the
   pile in the centre over 99. You can push the value up to 99 to make the
   other players struggle, and you can reverse the direction of play to
   save yourself when needed. It's best to save your smaller value cards
   and special cards until the end stages of the GAME so you have them
   when you need them.

   Children will enjoy the speed of the GAME and creating strategies to
   stay afloat when the value of the pile is high.

   How to play 99

Personal recommendations

   All of the above GAME have a special place in my heart, but here are a
   couple you might not have heard of. I have fond memories of playing
   these with friends, family and strangers alike.

   Rummoli

   Rummoli, aka Tripoli, is a Canadian GAME that is part board GAME and
   part poker. It's a delight and my favourite GAME for a large group of
   people. It's light on strategy and heavy on fun.

   An ideal group for Rummoli is four to six players, but it can be played
   with as few as two and as many as eight. The more players there are,
   the faster the GAME goes.

   Ideally, you'd play with a Rummoli board, but if you don't have one,
   you can just mark designated spaces on a large piece of paper where
   players can place their chips. These areas correspond to different
   cards or sequences in the second phase of the GAME. Each player puts a
   chip on each space on the board. There's also a pot which goes to the
   winner of the poker phase. That phase is a traditional hand of poker;
   whoever has the highest-ranking hand wins.

   After the poker GAME, people play their cards in sequence. The twist is
   there's a "ghost" hand dealt, and cards from this hand cannot be
   played. There's a chance you won't be able to complete a sequence
   because one of the preceding cards is in the ghost hand.

   How to play Rummoli

   Spite and Malice

   I learned this GAME while I was on holiday in 2018. It's designed for
   two players, but can be played with more. (I learned a four-player
   version.) If you like to meddle with your opponents' strategy as much
   as trying to win for yourself, this is the GAME for you.

   The objective of the GAME is get rid of all the cards in your "payoff
   pile" by playing them on stacks in the centre of the table. The card on
   top of each player's payoff pile is always turned face up, so you know
   which card your opponents are trying to get rid of, and you can try to
   block them from playing those cards.

   It can be gratifying to watch an opponent end their turn because it's
   their only possible move. Spite and Malice is one of the more strategic
   GAME listed here. It's a lot of fun; just be sure not to ruin any
   friendships while you're on your quest to win.

   Owning a beautiful deck of custom playing cards is a joy. While they
   may rest elegantly on your shelf, their true allure emerges when used.
   Holding them, feeling their embossed texture, and appreciating the
   intricate designs adds to the experience. Moreover, these decks are not
   just for admiration; they come alive when used for card GAME,
   cardistry, or magic tricks.

   But one of the best methods to enjoy these decks is by playing card
   GAME. Not only do you get the pleasure of using them, but others also
   get the chance to admire and enjoy their design. During GAME breaks,
   players can also appreciate the detailed artwork, which enhances the
   overall experience.

   Now, what GAME to play? While many are familiar with a few standard
   card GAME, there's a vast world of card GAME yet to be explored. Over
   the years, despite my extensive collection of modern GAME, I've found
   myself drawn to traditional card GAME, especially when I have a custom
   deck at hand.

   Here's a compilation of my top traditional card GAME, sorted
   alphabetically, and categorized for adults or children. At the end,
   I've listed books and resources on card GAME that I personally
   recommend. Each GAME's description includes its ideal player count.
   Notably, many of these GAME are perfect for just two participants.

   This list primarily focuses on traditional card GAME that have stood
   the test of time. While some recent GAME are mentioned, the primary
   goal is to highlight GAME that use a standard deck, rather than modern
   adaptations. Of course, there are countless other GAME playable with a
   standard deck; this list represents the most well-known and those I've
   personally enjoyed or recognize as classics.

   I hope this inspires you to explore beyond the usual and dive into some
   classic card GAME. Trust me, the journey is rewarding with many
   fantastic GAME awaiting discovery. For easy access to GAME rules, each
   GAME listed is linked to Pagat.com, an authoritative source for card
   GAME guidelines.

Social and Family GAME

   This category is somewhat arbitrary in that some of the card GAME in
   the other categories can also be enjoyed socially or with children, and
   the GAME in this category are certainly not just for children. But if
   I was looking for a fun and lighter GAME that is easy to learn and
   play, these are all excellent choices.
   Blitz (2-12 players) - A popular and casual/social card GAME, also
   known as "Scat", "Thirty-One", "Ride the Bus", and "Blitz". By drawing
   and discarding a card each turn, the aim is to try to improve your
   three card hand to have the closest to 31 points in one suit.
   Cheat (3-13 players) - Also called "I Doubt It" or "Bullsh**", this is
   a GAME many children have played. The aim is to be the first to get rid
   of all your cards, and you can bluff about what cards you are playing
   on a turn, but if you get challenged and caught out you have to pick up
   the entire pile.
   Egyptian Ratscrew (2-6 players) - This is a quick-slapping GAME that is
   like Slap Jack on steroids, and has been published commercially under
   the name Slamwich.
   Fan Tan (3-6 players) - Also known as "Sevens", "Domino", "Parliament",
   and "Pay or Play". In turns players play a card to a common layout,
   which will begin with sevens as the foundation for each suit. Once a
   seven is played, you can build up or down on that suit, with the aim to
   be the first to play all your cards.

   Golf (2-6 players) - A great casual GAME for two players that also
   works with 3 or more. There are many variations, the most common one
   being six card Golf, where everyone has a 3x2 grid of cards worth
   varying points, that you try to improve. Just like in real golf, the
   goal is to get the lowest score possible over nine holes or hands.

   GOPS (2 players) - A simple and quick bidding/bluffing GAME for two
   players. The Diamonds are point cards corresponding to their value, and
   revealed one at a time in random order. Players each get an entire suit
   as their hand (Clubs or Spades), and play a card of their choice, with
   the revealed point card going to the higher played card. GOPS is an
   acronym for "GAME Of Pure Strategy", since there is zero luck.
   Knock Out Whist (2-7 players) - Also called "Trumps", this is a
   simplified version of Whist, where the aim is to avoid elimination
   after each hand by winning at least one trick. The first hand has seven
   tricks, and it becomes harder to stay in the GAME because each
   successive hand has one less trick. A perfect GAME to introduce people
   to trick-taking.
   Mao (2-7 players) - This GAME has especially been popular in college
   and university crowds since the 1960s, and the aim is not just to win
   but to have fun. Essentially it is a Crazy Eights variant with special
   additions, but the rules may not be discussed; new players are expected
   to try to figure out the rules by observing a GAME and by trial and
   error. Theoretically there are overtones of Mornington Crescent,
   Fizzbin, and Calvinball, but Mao is actually a playable GAME.
   Palace (2-6 players) - Also called "Sh**head", "Karma" or "Idiot". A
   very light casual GAME, where the aim is to avoid being last to get rid
   of your cards. Players each have a row of three face down cards, a row
   of three face up cards covering these, and a hand of three cards. On
   your turn you play cards equal or higher than the card on the discard
   pile, otherwise you pick up the entire pile.
   President (3-16 players) - Classically known as "Chairman," "Scum," or
   "A**hole", and fun for groups, this is an easy introduction to the
   family of climbing GAME. The aim is to get rid of cards as soon as
   possible, and you must play at least as many cards as the previous
   player, but with higher values. Depending on the order in which players
   go out, a new hierarchy of players is established. A variation of this
   was published commercially as The Great Dalmuti. For more advanced
   climbing GAME, see Big Two later on this list.
   Ranter-Go-Round (3-12 players) - This is also known as "Screw Your
   Neighbor",  "Chase The Ace" or "Cuckoo", with slight variations. A
   simple GAME of passing cards around, with a high luck element, the
   player with the lowest card at the end loses a chip, and the aim is to
   avoid being eliminated by losing your chips.
   Rummy (2-6 players) - A classic card GAME, in which players draw and
   discard cards, trying to get "melds" that typically consist of sets of
   the same values or runs of consecutive values. Many variants exist,
   including Gin Rummy, which is an excellent GAME and appears later on
   this list, as well as some commercially published GAME like
   the Mystery Rummy series. Contract Rummy (3-5 players) also developed
   from Rummy, and adds the complication that in each round players have
   to fulfil a different contract, which is a fixed combination of sets or
   runs, that they must have before they can meld. A version of Contract
   Rummy was published commercially under the name Phase Ten.
   Scopa (2-6 players) - A fascinating classic Italian card GAME that is
   especially good for two players, and for four players as a partnership
   GAME called Scopone. Players are using cards in their hand to "capture"
   point-scoring cards from a common pool, with captured cards matching or
   adding up to the value of the card played from hand. Also recommended
   is Escoba (3-4 players), which is the Spanish name for the Scopa di
   Quindici variant common in Brazil, in which you capture cards that add
   to a total of 15 by including a card from your hand. Closely related to
   Scopa is Casino, which has gives some added options for play, and
   appears later on this list.
   Speed (2-4 players) - Also called "Spit", this a high speed GAME
   similar in style to Nertz (see later on this list), but slightly easier
   and more suitable for children. The aim is to be the first to get rid
   of all your cards by simultaneously and quickly playing cards of higher
   or lower value to a common stock.
   Spoons (2-8 players) - A hilarious GAME for kids or large groups, also
   known as "Pig" or "Donkey". Players have four cards and simultaneously
   pass a card to the left, trying to get a set of four matching cards, at
   which point they take a spoon from the center, which is the signal for
   everyone to grab a spoon - but there is one less spoon available than
   the number of players! "My Ship Sails" is a variation that has the aim
   to collect seven cards of the same suit.
   My Ship Sails


Trick-Taking GAME

   Trick taking GAME are one of the most common types of card GAME, and
   classics like Hearts and Spades are good examples. It is a GAME where
   players all have a hand of cards, and GAME-play revolves around a
   series of "tricks", in which each trick involves everyone playing one
   card from their hand, with the trick typically going to the person who
   played the highest card. If you have never played a trick-taking GAME
   before, I suggest you start with Knock Out Whist, which was listed in
   the previous category, and is an excellent and fun way to get
   introduced to this style of GAME.
   500 (4 players) - The national card GAME of Australia. A skilful
   trick-taking GAME where players bid for the number of tricks they think
   their partnership can win. The winning bidder is allowed to exchange
   several cards, and select the trump. There is much to love: the
   trick-taking; the bidding and selecting trump; the exchanging with the
   kitty to manipulate your hand; the playing in partnerships. A variant
   for three players also exists.
   Bezique (2 players) - A classic trick-taker for two players that
   originated in France, was very popular in the early 20th century, and
   has some similarities to the two player version of the American
   GAME Pinochle.
   Bridge (4 players) - The ultimate classic among trick-taking card
   GAME. It is played in partnerships, and gives much room for much
   skilful play. Contract Bridge is often played in organized club
   settings, and the bidding and GAME-play has an extensive series of
   conventions that can take some time to learn in order to play well.
   Briscola (2-6 players) - An Italian trick-taking GAME that is quite
   easy to learn and play especially as a two player GAME. Using just 40
   cards, the aim is play tricks from your hand of three in order to win
   point scoring cards. Apparently this is especially good with the five
   player Briscola Chiamata variant.
   Euchre (4 players) - Extremely popular as a social GAME in parts of
   Canada and the USA, Euchre can especially be fun when played in a
   casual tournament setting. Just 25 cards are used, with the Jacks being
   powerful "bowers". One partnership is trying to win the most tricks
   from a five card hand, with trump determined by a turned up
   card. Ecarte (2 players) is an excellent trick-taking GAME that is very
   similar to Euchre, but better suited for a two player GAME.
   German Whist (2 players) - An excellent Whist style GAME for two
   players. Each player has a hand of 13 cards, and the first phase
   involves each person playing a card in order to compete for the face up
   card from the top of the stock (the very first card shown is the trump
   suit); the winner gets that card, the loser gets the next face-down
   card. When the stock is gone, you play out your remaining 13 cards, and
   the player winning the most tricks is the winner.
   Hearts (3-7 players) - One of the all time classic trick-taking GAME,
   where the aim is to avoid taking tricks with Hearts, since these are
   minus points, while the Queen of Spades is a whopping 13 minus points.
   There is no trump suit.
   Jass (2-4 players) - The national Swiss GAME, playable with two players
   or in partnerships. This is part of the Jass family which originated in
   the Netherlands. The wider family
   includes Belote (French), Klabberjass/Clob (German),
   and Klaverjassen (Dutch). The Swiss Jass is somewhat similar
   to Bezique and Pinochle.
   Le Truc (2 players) - This out-of-the-ordinary
   betting/bluffing/trick-taking GAME is a 19th century French GAME using
   a 32 card deck, and was especially popularized after inclusion in Sid
   Sackson's Gamut of GAME. A brilliant bluffing GAME where you use a
   hand of three cards to play only three tricks, but can increase the
   value of a hand throughout the GAME, to bluff and cause your opponent
   to fold. Be aware of some rule variations. Both the French Le Truc and
   the Spanish Truc (which has 2 player partnerships) are derived from the
   older English GAME Put (2 players), which is a simpler two player
   bluffing GAME that I can also recommend.
   Ninety-Nine (3 players) - This original GAME by David Parlett is
   regarded as one of the very best trick-taking GAME for exactly 3
   players. Only 36 cards are used, and from a hand of 12 players lay
   aside three cards that represent the number of their bid, and play out
   the remaining 9 cards in tricks, trying to win exactly the number of
   tricks corresponding to their bid.
   Oh Hell (3-7 players) - This goes under many names, including Up and
   Down the River, Bust, Estimation, and some less savoury titles that are
   variations on Oh ****. A great trick taking GAME where you bid how many
   tricks you can win, while the hand size increases or decreases each
   round. The GAME enables considerable skill, because even with bad cards
   you score if you bid correctly. Numerous scoring variants exist, one
   being published commercially under the name Wizard.
   Pinochle (4 players) - A popular and classic American trick-taking GAME
   for partnerships that uses an 80 card deck. Gameplay starts with an
   auction in which players bid how many points their team will win, with
   highest bidder picking trump. Each player gets a hand of 20 cards, and
   individual cards are worth points, as well as combinations of cards in
   hand (melds). A two-player variant of Pinochle using a single-deck also
   exists.
   Piquet (2 players) - This classic GAME has a very long history going
   back several centuries. It is demanding since it has some old-fashioned
   complications, but is still popular, and regarded as one of the
   all-time best and most skilful card GAME for just two players.
   Pitch (4 players) - Derived from the old English GAME All Fours, this
   GAME has especially been popular in parts of the USA, and there are
   many variations. Typically played in partnerships, it begins with a
   bidding round after players each are dealt six cards, and bid for many
   of the following four items they think they will have at the end of a
   hand: High trump, trick with low trump, trick with Jack of trumps, and
   highest total point value.
   Rook (4 players) - Rook is a terrific partnership trick taking GAME
   with bidding that was even published commercially under that name with
   a special deck. The aim is to win tricks with point cards (e.g. the
   Rook=Joker card is worth 20 points), rather than the maximum number of
   tricks. The highest bidder has choice of trump, and can exchange with
   the "nest/kitty" in order to improve their hand. Several good
   variations exist, and in parts of Canada one of them is played under
   the name 200 (in French: Deux Cents).
   Schnapsen (2 players) - Popular in many parts of Europe, Schnapsen is
   the national card GAME of Austria, and is a classic trick-taking card
   GAME for two players with a long history, and allows for genuinely
   skilful and clever play. Played with a small deck, one of its
   peculiarities is how points are scored for "marriages" (King-Queen
   couples). For a comprehensive look at the difference between the
   closely related Sixty Six, and common Schnapsen rule variations,
   see here and here.
   Skat (3 players) - This classic trick-taking GAME is the national card
   GAME of Germany. It features complex scoring and bidding, but is one of
   the best card GAME for three players. A similar GAME with simpler
   bidding and scoring rules is Schafkopf, which was been Americanized and
   popularized by immigrants to the USA as Sheepshead. Also related is the
   demanding Doppelkopf (i.e. Double Sheepshead).
   Spades (4 players) - One of the better trick taking GAME for
   partnerships, and another classic after being invented and popularized
   in the USA in the 1930s. Spades are always the trumps, and players bid
   how many tricks they think they will win in advance. Although the
   bidding and scoring is not the easiest if you are new to trick-taking
   GAME, it is a GAME that allows for more skill than casual GAME like
   euchre.
   Whist (4 players) - A simple but classic trick-taking card GAME from
   which many others are derived. Played in partnerships, there is no
   trump, and teams try to win the most tricks as they play out a full
   hand of 13 cards. Good variations include titles elsewhere on this
   list, like German Whist (2 players) and Knock Out Whist (3-7 players).

Non Trick-Taking GAME

   Trick taking GAME are arguably one of the most popular and common
   types of card GAME, which is why they were listed as a separate
   category. But there are certainly a large number of other fantastic
   card GAME as well. Most of the GAME listed in the "Social and Family
   GAME" category were also non tricking-taking GAME, but the GAME
   listed below tend to be a little more thoughtful and involved.
   Big Two (4 players) - Best with four players (although variants for 2-3
   players exist), this along with President (which appears earlier on
   this list) represents one of the more accessible and well-known
   climbing GAME. With the climbing genre, the idea is to be the first
   player to get rid of all your cards, playing cards individually or in
   special combinations. For a slightly easier climbing GAME than Big Two,
   consider Tien Len, which is the national card GAME of Vietnam. One of
   the most popular climbing GAME of all times is Tichu, which was
   published commercially with a special deck.
   Canasta (4 players) - A GAME that became extremely popular in the
   1950s, Canasta uses two standard decks, and is best in two-player
   partnerships. It is a rummy style of GAME in which the aim is to make
   melds of seven cards of the same value, and "go out" by playing your
   entire hand. There are also several variants, such as the popular Hand
   and Foot.
   Casino (2-4 players) - This classic card GAME is a "fishing" GAME that
   has some parallels to the simpler Scopa (see earlier on this list), and
   the Anglo-American version is especially popular. Players capture
   face-up cards in a common pool by playing matching cards from their
   hand, either individually or a number of cards that adds to a total
   equalling the card played from hand. Unlike Scopa, players have more
   options, and can also build cards together for later, which adds a more
   tactical element.
   Cribbage (2 players) - A classic card name based on card combinations
   worth points, with the aim of being first to 121 points, scored by
   pegging on a board. Players each get a hand of six cards, and must set
   aside two to a "crib" which will later score for one of the two
   players. Cards are played in turns, adding their values together until
   you reach or near 31, and then this is repeated. Players score for
   combinations like cards that add to 15, pairs/triples, or runs, and
   also score for their hand at the end. Despite the casual feel, there is
   considerable skill, and experienced players will consistently
   outperform novices. Requires decision making for selecting cards for
   the crib, and which order to play the cards in hand. Even children will
   enjoy finding the point scoring combinations, while the
   imbalance/asymmetry of each GAME turn makes it especially interesting.
   Eleusis (4-8 players) - A modern card GAME simulating scientific
   research, as players ("scientists") conduct experiments to determine
   the rule governing play. Players try to get rid of cards by discarding
   them, but the "rule" that allows legal play is invented by the dealer
   and is unknown to the players, and they must try to figure out the rule
   by deducing it from legal plays.
   Gin Rummy (2 players) - Derived from Rummy (see earlier on this list),
   Gin Rummy is a "knocking GAME" that differs from Rummy in that melds
   are kept in hand until the end of a deal. It is an excellent and
   time-tested two player GAME.
   Nertz (2-6 players) - Also known as "Racing Demon" or "Pounce", Nertz
   is a competitive multi-player solitaire that is played in real time.
   The aim is to be the first to get rid of cards from your Nertz piles by
   building upwards on common foundations. It is basically the same GAME
   as the commercially available Ligretto/Dutch Blitz, but played with a
   standard deck.
   Poker (2-10 players) - This is considered the ultimate bluffing GAME,
   and No Limit Texas Hold 'Em has been popularized with the help of
   television and local tournaments. Players "bet" chips on whether or not
   they have the best five card poker hand. Many say it is only fun when
   played for money, suggesting that the thrill is in the gambling rather
   than the GAME-play. Even if you do not play for money, you do have to
   approach the GAME semi-seriously for it to be fun, otherwise it is too
   easy for someone to play foolishly and hand another player the GAME. A
   must for those who enjoy bluffing.
   Spite &amp Malice (2-5 players) - Also known as "Cat &amp Mouse", this is a
   competitive patience/solitaire GAME for two or more players that uses
   two decks, and is better known to most people under its commercially
   produced variation, Skip-Bo. Unlike Speed and Nertz, it is not played
   simultaneously in real time, because players take turns, but the
   overall concept is somewhat similar.
   Zetema (2 players) - This is an obscure Victorian card GAME that
   revived in popularity as a result of Sid Sackson's A Gamut of GAME.
   David Parlett recommends it as an out-of-the-ordinary card GAME that is
   "long and savory". It is played with a 65-card deck (52 cards plus an
   additional two through Ace in one suit), and each player's objective is
   to reach a certain number of points scored by discarding assemblies,
   completing tricks, setting up marriages, or revealing flushes and
   sequences. Also playable with four or six players in partnerships.

Recommendations

   So where should you start? Hopefully some of the descriptions I have
   provided will intrigue you enough to give a particular GAME a shot, or
   look into it further. But often GAME will depend on who you are
   playing with, the number of players you have, and the kind of GAME you
   are looking for. So to help you branch out beyond the repertoire that
   you might already be familiar with, here are some recommendations for
   GAME that I especially suggest for different situations.
   Are you looking for...
   - a GAME for just two players? GOPS and Scopa are two simpler GAME
   that are quite rewarding. If you want a trick-taking GAME for just two,
   then Briscola and German Whist are both straight forward and good
   choices, while Le Truc is fantastic for those who like bluffing,
   and Schnapsen is worth the effort to learn if you enjoy skilful
   play. Cribbage and Gin Rummy are two non trick-taking classics that are
   every bit as good today as they have always been.
   - a GAME for four-players in partnerships? There are several good
   trick-taking GAME to choose from in this category, and while the
   ever-popular Bridge is good, the learning curve can be steep. I
   recommend starting with a simpler GAME like Euchre or Whist, or else
   something that involves more skill, like 500, Rook, or Spades, which
   incorporate the fun of bidding and give opportunity for a winning
   bidder to strengthen their hand.
   - a trick-taking GAME for an odd number of players? Ninety-Nine is the
   best trick-taker that plays with exactly three players. Hearts and Oh
   Hell can both handle various player counts, and are very good; if you
   enjoy bidding for how many tricks you think you will win then Oh Hell
   is an absolute must.
   - a light social GAME for a larger group? Try the classic climbing
   GAME President, the almost brainless Ranter-Go-Round, or the frenzy
   of Spoons, all of which are easy to learn and don not require too much
   brain power. Blitz and Cheat are also good choices for fun social GAME
   that can work with more than four players.
   - a GAME that is fast-paced? Try the craziness of two
   player Speed/Spit, or else ramp up the difficulty slightly with the
   frantic GAME-play of the popular Nertz, both of which have simultaneous
   real-time GAME-play. Egyptian Ratscrew also requires quick reactions
   and speed.
   - a GAME that is unusual and out-of-the-ordinary? Try the logical
   deduction required by the clever and inventive Eleusis, or the long and
   savoury gameplay of Zetema.
   - a GAME for older children? Most of the GAME in the "Social and
   Family GAME" category will work, but fun GAME that I have had good
   success with in playing with children include Cheat, Fan Tan, Knock Out
   Whist (which also serves as a good introduction to
   trick-taking), Palace, Speed, and Spoons. If they can handle the
   scoring system, Scopa is definitely a rewarding GAME that older
   children can enjoy, and the partnership GAME Scopone is particularly
   good. GOPS produces an excellent head-to-head battle-of-wits for just
   two, and so does Golf.
   - a GAME for younger children? There's a number of classic and very
   simple GAME not included on this list, such as Beggar My
   Neighbour (2-3 players), Crazy Eights (2-7 players), Go Fish (2-6
   players), Old Maid (2-12 players), Slap Jack (2-8 players), Snap (2-4
   players), and War (2 players). Be aware that some GAME like Beggar My
   Neighbour and also War involve no decisions and are a matter of pure
   luck!

Solitaire GAME

   But what about if you have nobody to play with? The good news is that
   there is a wide range of excellent solitaire card GAME, a category
   sometimes referred to with the catch-all "Patience". Patience or
   Solitaire GAME are especially popular due to the fact that many of
   them come pre-installed on personal computer operating systems. Some
   solitaire GAME come down to pure luck, but there are many excellent
   ones that require genuine skill, and can be a very rewarding challenge
   to play.
   Rules: Fortunately you can learn many solitaire GAME with the help of
   free apps, or the many websites that offer these GAME to play for
   free. You will find lots of resources online that will teach you rules
   for different GAME, and a good place to begin is the Wikipedia page
   which lists solitaire GAME. Also check Polymorphic Solitaire, Pretty
   Good Solitaire, and Solitaire Network, which all have extensive lists
   of solitaire GAME, rules for each, and free online play.
   Recommendations: There are different types of solitaire GAME, and here
   are some of the better and more popular ones I can recommend, grouped
   according to different categories:
   Adding and pairing types: Golf, Monte Carlo, Pyramid
   Non-builder types: Clock Patience, Grandfather's Clock, Accordion
   Fan types: La Belle Lucie, The Fan, Super Flower Garden, Shamrocks,
   Bristol
   Builder types: Baker’s Dozen, Beleaguered Castle, Canfield, Forty
   Thieves, Freecell, Klondike, Miss Milligan, Russian Solitaire,
   Scorpion, Spider, Yukon
   Other types: Aces Up, Calculation
   Thematic: I also highly recommend Bowling Solitaire by genius GAME
   designer Sid Sackson. It is entirely unlike all the other solitaire
   GAME mentioned, but is an incredibly thematic and clever GAME.
   Apps: There are some fantastic apps available for free which have a
   wide range of solitaire GAME. Of the ones I have tried, I can
   especially recommend Full Deck Solitaire (by GRL GAME), Solebon
   Solitaire (by Solebon LLC), and Solitaire City (by Digital Smoke LLC).
   Of course you do not want to only play using apps, but these will help
   you learn the rules, and then you can pull out your actual deck of
   cards and have fun playing with them!

Other Ideas

   This article should get you well on your way to playing some fun card
   GAME. But if you are interested in exploring the world of card GAME
   further, there is certainly a lot more you can do. So here are some
   ideas for further expanding your horizons, learning more about the
   great card GAME that are out there, and even options for playing them
   when you have nobody else around to play with.
   Get a book: There are some fantastic books with rules to all the
   classic card GAME. You will need some way to learn how to play a new
   GAME, and resolve those inevitable rules arguments that might arise.
   Having a reliable book is something you can take with you when you are
   on the go. Here are two of the best:
   ● The Penguin Book of Card GAME - Also published under the title The
   Penguin Encyclopedia of Card GAME, this book by David Parlett is
   easily the most comprehensive book in the English language with
   standard card GAME. If you are looking to discover new GAME, or find
   rules to lots of different GAME, this is the best book to get.
   ● Hoyle's Rules of GAME - An authoritative and standard text on
   classic card GAME. I personally own the Third Revised edition (Philip
   D. Morehead), and have used it often, although it is not as exhaustive
   as David Parlett's book, so it can happen that the card GAME of your
   choice is not included. But the section on card GAME is very useful,
   especially the contents pages which categorizes the GAME by
   suitability for adults/children and by number of players; plus it has
   rules to other classic GAME as well. This book and a deck of playing
   cards is all you need to take along on a vacation!
   Check online resources: There are some terrific resources online about
   traditional card GAME. Pagat.com is easily the most authoritative and
   best when it comes to rules, but there are certainly other places that
   are helpful as well. Suggestions to get you started:
   ● Pagat.com - John McLeod's award-winning site is considered to be the
   most exhaustive website with rules for different card GAME played with
   a standard deck. An outstanding and useful resource.
   ● BicycleCards.com - Bicycle's official website has their official
   rules for many different card GAME. It also has a helpful search
   function that allows you to find a suitable card GAME based on the
   number of players, who is playing, and type of GAME.
   ● BoardGameGeek.com - BoardGameGeek.com is the world's largest
   community of boardgamers. This page lists a number of GAME that can be
   played with a standard deck of playing cards, and gives some other
   links to their site. Also check their family page for traditional card
   GAME for more.
   ● Poker Suite - Cheapass GAME offers a free download of the rules PDF
   for their Poker Suite, which is a collection of 14 original GAME that
   is well worth looking at.
   ● Femtitvå - Scott Huntington's free collection of 10 clever card GAME
   is inspired by modern GAME like Ticket to Ride and 7 Wonders.
   ● Isaludo - A set of ten modern card GAME designed to be played
   solitaire, created by hobbyist gamer Wilhelm Su from the Philippines.
   Play using an app: If you are not quite sure on the rules of how to
   play a specific card GAME mentioned above, there are plenty of apps
   available that will help you with that. The ideal way to learn a GAME
   is to have someone teach you, but an app is a fantastic second best,
   because it will enforce the rules. Many of them also include tutorials.
   There are quite a few software programs for card GAME that are readily
   available as well - most versions of Windows will come with Hearts and
   Spades, and some solitaire GAME too. Here are some good free apps for
   iOS for some of the GAME listed above; I've personally used, enjoyed,
   and can recommend all of these: Cribbage Craze (Cribbage) by Tim
   Eakins, Thirty One Rummy (Blitz) by North Sky GAME, Briscola
   Pro (Briscola) by Appsmob, Scopa Dal Negro (Scopa) by Digitalmoka
   Sri, Master Schnapsen/66 Lite (Schnapsen) by Psellos, Truco
   Argentina (Le Truc) by Jaime Garcia Ghirelli. There is also a great
   free app called Bicycle How To Play by United States Playing Card
   Company. You cannot play any GAME with this app, but it comes with
   rules for many of the most popular card GAME, so it functions as a
   digital document you can use on the fly to find the rules you need.
   Play online: Playing with an app that incorporates multiplayer GAME is
   one way to play online, but there are also websites dedicated to this
   purpose as well. This is not something I have tried much myself, but
   here are a few that you can start
   with: cardGAME.io, worldofcardGAME.com, trickstercards.com,
   and cardzmania.com.
   Ask family and friends: Many families have their household favourites.
   Perhaps some of your friends know some great card GAME that they would
   just love to teach you! A night playing card GAME with family or
   friends makes for a relaxing social evening, and is a great way to
   spend time together.
   Hoyle's rules of GAME
   So dust off that custom deck that is looking down at you expectantly
   from the shelf, invite over some family or friends, and get those
   playing cards to the table. Enjoy your deck and discover the fun that
   playing card GAME has been bringing people around the world for
   centuries!

   GAME using playing cards as the primary device
   For other uses, see Card GAME (disambiguation).

   [220px-Theodoor_Rombouts_-_Joueurs_de_cartes.jpg] The Card Players,
   17th-century painting by Theodoor Rombouts

   A card GAME is any GAME using playing cards as the primary device with
   which the GAME is played, be they traditional or GAME-specific.
   Countless card GAME exist, including families of related GAME (such
   as poker). A small number of card GAME played with traditional decks
   have formally standardized rules with international tournaments being
   held, but most are folk GAME whose rules may vary by region, culture,
   location or from circle to circle.

   Traditional card GAME are played with a deck or pack of playing cards
   which are identical in size and shape. Each card has two sides, the
   face and the back. Normally the backs of the cards are
   indistinguishable. The faces of the cards may all be unique, or there
   can be duplicates. The composition of a deck is known to each player.
   In some cases several decks are shuffled together to form a single pack
   or shoe. Modern card GAME usually have bespoke decks, often with a
   vast amount of cards, and can include number or action cards. This type
   of GAME is generally regarded as part of the board GAME hobby.

   GAME using playing cards exploit the fact that cards are individually
   identifiable from one side only, so that each player knows only the
   cards they hold and not those held by anyone else. For this reason card
   GAME are often characterized as GAME of chance or "imperfect
   information"—as distinct from GAME of strategy or perfect information,
   where the current position is fully visible to all players throughout
   the GAME.^[1] Many GAME that are not generally placed in the family of
   card GAME do in fact use cards for some aspect of their play.

   Some GAME that are placed in the card GAME genre involve a board. The
   distinction is that the play in a card GAME chiefly depends on the use
   of the cards by players (the board is a guide for scorekeeping or for
   card placement), while board GAME (the principal non-card GAME genre
   to use cards) generally focus on the players' positions on the board,
   and use the cards for some secondary purpose.

History[edit]

14th and 15th centuries[edit]

   Despite the presence of playing cards in Europe being recorded from
   around 1370, it is not until 1408 that the first card GAME is described
   in a document about the exploits of two card sharps; although it is
   evidently very simple, the GAME is not named. In fact the earliest
   GAME to be mentioned by name are Gleek, Ronfa and Condemnade, the
   latter being the GAME played by the aforementioned card cheats. All
   three are recorded during the 15th century,^[2] along with Karnöffel,
   first mentioned in 1426 and which is still played in several forms
   today, including Bruus, Knüffeln, Kaiserspiel and Styrivolt.

   Since the arrival of trick-taking GAME in Europe in the late 14th
   century, there have only been two major innovations. The first was the
   introduction of trump cards with the power to beat all cards in other
   suits.^[3] Such cards were initially called trionfi and first appeared
   with the advent of Tarot cards in which there is a separate, permament
   trump suit comprising a number of picture cards.^[4] The first known
   example of such cards was ordered by the Duke of Milan around 1420 and
   included 16 trumps with images of Greek and Roman gods.^[5] Thus GAME
   played with Tarot cards appeared very early on and spread to most parts
   of Europe with the notable exceptions of the British Isles, the Iberian
   Peninsula, and the Balkans.^[6] However, we do not know the rules of
   the early Tarot GAME; the earliest detailed description in any
   language being those published by the Abbé de Marolles in Nevers in
   1637.^[7]^[8]

   The concept of trumps was sufficiently powerful that it was soon
   transferred to GAME played with far cheaper ordinary packs of cards,
   as opposed to expensive Tarot cards. The first of these was Triomphe,
   the name simply being the French equivalent of the Italian trionfi.
   Although not testified before 1538, its first rules were written by a
   Spaniard who left his native country for Milan in 1509 never to return;
   thus the GAME may date to the late 15th century.^[9]^[10]^[11]

   Others GAME that may well date to the 15th century are Pochen – the
   GAME of Bocken or Boeckels being attested in Strasbourg in 1441^[12] –
   and Thirty-One, which is first mentioned in a French translation of a
   1440 sermon by the Italian, Saint Bernadine, the name actually
   referring to two different card GAME: one like Pontoon and one like
   Commerce.^[13]

16th century[edit]

   In the 16th century printed documents replace handwritten sources and
   card GAME become a popular topic with preachers, autobiographists and
   writers in general. A key source of the GAME in vogue in France and
   Europe at that time is François Rabelais, whose fictional character
   Gargantua played no less than 30 card GAME, many of which are
   recognisable. They include: Aluette, Bête, Cent, Coquimbert, Coucou,
   Flush or Flux, Gé (Pairs), Gleek, Lansquenet, Piquet, Post and Pair,
   Primero, Ronfa, Triomphe, Sequence, Speculation, Tarot and
   Trente-et-Un; possibly Rams, Mouche and Brandeln as well.^[14] Girolamo
   Cardano also provides invaluable information including the earliest
   rules of Trappola. Among the most popular were the GAME of Flusso and
   Primiera, which originated in Italy and spread throughout Europe,
   becoming known in England as Flush and Primero.^[8]

   In Britain the earliest known European fishing GAME was recorded in
   1522.^[15] Another first was Losing Loadum, noted by Florio in 1591,
   which is the earliest known English point-trick GAME.^[16] In Scotland,
   the GAME of Mawe, testified in the 1550s, evolved from a country GAME
   into one played at the royal Scottish court, becoming a favourite of
   James VI.^[17] The ancestor of Cribbage – a GAME called Noddy – is
   mentioned for the first time in 1589, "Noddy" being the Knave turned
   for trump at the start of play.^[18]

17th century[edit]

   The 17th century saw an upsurge in the number of new GAME being
   reported as well as the first sets of rules, those for Piquet appearing
   in 1632 and Reversis in 1634.^[8] The first French GAME compendium, La
   Maison Académique, appeared in 1654 and it was followed in 1674 by
   Charles Cotton's The Compleat GAMEter, although an earlier manuscript
   of GAME by Francis Willughby was written sometime between 1665 and
   1670.^[19] Cotton records the first rules for the classic English GAME
   of Cribbage, a descendant of Noddy, and Whist, a development of English
   Trump or Ruff ('ruff' then meaning 'rob') in which four players were
   dealt 12 cards each and the dealer 'robbed' from the remaining stock of
   4 cards.^[20]

   Piquet was a two-player, trick-taking GAME that originated in France,
   probably in the 16th century and was initially played with 36 cards
   before, around 1690, the pack reduced to the 32 cards that gives the
   Piquet pack its name. Reversis is a reverse GAME in which players avoid
   taking tricks and appears to be an Italian invention that came to
   France around 1600 and spread rapidly to other countries in Europe.^[8]

   In the mid-17th century, a certain GAME named after Cardinal Mazarin,
   prime minister to King Louis XIV, became very popular at the French
   royal court. Called Hoc Mazarin, it had three phases, the final one of
   which evolved into a much simpler GAME called Manille that was renamed
   Comète on the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1682.^[21] In Comète the
   aim is to be first to shed all one's hand cards to sequences laid out
   in rows on the table. However, there are certain cards known as 'stops'
   or hocs: cards that end a sequence and give the one who played it the
   advantage of being able to start a new sequence. This concept spread to
   other 17th and 18th century GAME including Poque, Comete, Emprunt,
   Manille, Nain Jaune and Lindor,^[22]^[23] all except Emprunt being
   still played in some form today.

   It was the 17th century that saw the second of the two great
   innovations being introduced into trick-taking GAME: the concept of
   bidding.^[3] This first emerged in the Spanish GAME of Ombre, an
   evolution of Triomphe that "in its time, was the most successful card
   GAME ever invented."^[24] Ombre's origins are unclear and obfuscated by
   the existence of a GAME called Homme or Bête in France, ombre and homme
   being respectively Spanish and French for 'man'. In Ombre, the player
   who won the bidding became the "Man" and played alone against the other
   two. The GAME spread rapidly across Europe, spawning variants for
   different numbers of players and known as Quadrille, Quintille,
   Médiateur and Solo. Quadrille went on to become highly fashionable in
   England during the 18th century and is mentioned several times, for
   example, in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.

   The first rules of any GAME in the German language were those for
   Rümpffen published in 1608 and later expanded in several subsequent
   editions. In addition, the first German GAME compendium, Palamedes
   Redivivus appeared in 1678, containing the rules for Hoick (Hoc),
   Ombre, Picquet (sic), Rümpffen and Thurnspiel.

18th century[edit]

   The evolution of card GAME continued apace, with notable national
   GAME emerging like Briscola and Tressette (Italy), Schafkopf
   (Bavaria), Jass (Switzerland), Mariage, the ancestor of Austria's
   Schnapsen and Germany's Sixty-Six, and Tapp Tarock, the progenitor of
   most modern central European Tarot GAME. Whist spread to the continent
   becoming very popular in the north and west. In France, Comet appeared,
   a GAME that later evolved into Nain Jaune and the Victorian GAME of
   Pope Joan.

Types[edit]

   [220px-Preferans_%28card_GAME%29_in_Croatia.2.jpg] Preferans, a
   trick-taking card GAME version popular in Croatia

   Card GAME may be classified in different ways: by their objective, by
   the equipment used (e.g. number of cards and type of suits), by country
   of origin or by mechanism (how the GAME is played). Parlett and McLeod
   predominantly group cards GAME by mechanism of which there are five
   categories: outplay, card exchange, hand comparison, layout and a
   miscellaneous category that includes combat and compendium GAME. These
   are described in the following sections.^[25]

Outplay GAME[edit]

   Easily the largest category of GAME in which players have a hand of
   cards and must play them out to the table. Play ends when players have
   played all their cards.^[25]

Trick-taking GAME[edit]

   See also: List of trick-taking GAME

   Trick-taking GAME are the largest category of outplay GAME. Players
   typically receive an equal number of cards and a trick involves each
   player playing a card face up to the table – the rules of play
   dictating what cards may be played and who wins the trick.^[26]

   There are two main types of trick-taking GAME with different
   objectives. Both are based on the play of multiple tricks, in each of
   which each player plays a single card from their hand, and based on the
   values of played cards one player wins or "takes" the trick. In
   plain-trick GAME the aim is to win a number of tricks, a specific
   trick or as many tricks as possible, without regard to the actual
   cards. In point-trick GAME, the number of tricks is immaterial; what
   counts is the value, in points, of the cards captured.^[26]

Plain-trick GAME[edit]

   Many common Anglo-American GAME fall into the category of plain-trick
   GAME. The usual objective is to take the most tricks, but variations
   taking all tricks, making as few tricks (or penalty cards) as possible
   or taking an exact number of tricks. Bridge, Whist and Spades are
   popular examples. Hearts, Black Lady and Black Maria are examples of
   reverse GAME in which the aim is to avoid certain cards. Plain-trick
   GAME may be divided into the following 11 groups:^[26]

     * Whist group. A standard Whist pack is used with cards ranking in
       their natural order and four players playing in partnerships of
       two. Usually a trump suit is nominated through turning a card or
       bidding and the aim is to win as many tricks as possible.
     * No trump GAME. As above but there is no trump suit.
     * Put group. In Put, tricks are won by the highest card regardless of
       suit. Treys are usually highest.
     * Last trick group. The player who makes the last trick wins (or
       loses) the hand.
     * Trump group. Either trump GAME in which fewer cards are dealt
       (e.g. 5) or in which there are chosen suits.
     * Ombre group. Ombre introduced one of the two most significant
       features in the history of card GAME: bidding. Other common
       characteristics of this family are 3 matadors and a talon of
       undealt cards.
     * Boston group. GAME of the Boston group are played like Whist, but
       players form alliances of two or three players depending on the
       outcome of bidding.
     * Auction Whist group. Auction or Bid Whist GAME involved fixed
       partnerships and an auction to determine the contract to be played.
     * Preference group. GAME of the Préférence family are typically for
       three players who 10 cards each from a 32-card pack and bid to play
       alone against the other two.
     * Exact bidding group. Players bid the exact number of tricks they
       expect to take and must achieve that to win.
     * Multi-trick group. Mostly Oriental GAME in which several cards may
       be led to a trick at once. However, some European GAME of the
       trump group, such as Bruus, also include this feature.

Point-trick GAME[edit]

   Point-trick GAME are all European or of European origin and include
   the Tarot card GAME. Individual cards have specific point values and
   the objective is usually to amass the majority of points by taking
   tricks, especially those with higher value cards. There are around nine
   main groups:^[26]
     * Tarot GAME. All Tarot GAME use Tarot cards for their original
       purpose of playing GAME and are either French- or Spanish-suited.
       The tarots form a special trump suit and the counting cards are the
       highest, second highest and lowest trumps along with the court
       cards. There are usually bonuses for certain feats or card
       combinations and most GAME have multiple contracts which the
       players may bid for. Notable examples include German Cego, Austrian
       Tarock, French Tarot and Italian Minchiate.
     * Manille group. A small group of mainly French and Spanish GAME
       originating in "Malille" characterised by the top card being the 9
       in Spanish GAME or the 10 in Belgian and French GAME. Additional
       counters are the AKQJ.
     * Couillon group. A small group from the Benelux countries in which
       the counters and highest cards are the ace (4), king (3), queen (2)
       and jack (1). A typical member is Luxembourgisch Konter a Matt.
     * Trappola group. This family is virtually extinct. Its progenitor,
       Trappola, was a Venetian GAME that emerged in the 1500s and was
       played with a special pack that is still available from Piatnik
       today. The counters are the ace (6), king (5), knight (4) and jack
       (3). There were bonuses for certain trick-winning feats.
     * All Fours group. Based on the old English GAME of All Fours in
       which there were GAME points for High (highest trump), Low (lowest
       trump), Jack (of trumps) and GAME (most card points). Surviving
       members of the group include American Pitch, British Phat and Irish
       Don.
     * Ace-Ten GAME. The Ace-Ten family includes most of the national
       GAME of Europe including German Skat, French Belote, Dutch
       Klaberjass, Austrian Schnapsen, Spanish Tute, Swiss Jass,
       Portuguese Sueca, Italian Briscola and Czech Mariáš. Pinochle is an
       American example of French or Swiss origin. Ace-Ten GAME may be
       further subdivided into the Schafkopf group, Marriage group (which
       includes the Jass group), the Sedma group and the German Tarok
       group (which includes American GAME like Frog and Six-Bid Solo.
     * Tresette group. Tressette is an Italian GAME with the odd card
       ranking of 32AKQJ7654. Aces count 1 point, treys, deuces and courts
       are worth 1⁄3 point each. Most are Italian variants of Tressette,
       but Les Quatre Sept is played in Canada.
     * Reverse GAME. Historically the most significant was Reversis, now
       rarely played. The best known reverse GAME today is Black Lady
       albeit often misnamed after its predecessor, Hearts, thanks to
       Microsoft. Reverse GAME often feature in compendium GAME.
     * Miscellaneous GAME. These include small families of Oriental GAME
       such as the King-Ten-Five group, in which the counters are the
       kings and tens (10 each) and fives (5), and Picture group, in which
       the AKQJT are worth 1 point each and in which Elfern is the only
       Western example. Of historical interest are Gleek and Penneech,
       while Cucco is one played with a special Cucco pack.

Beating GAME[edit]

   In beating GAME the idea is to beat the card just played if possible,
   otherwise it must be picked up, either alone or together with other
   cards, and added to the hand. In many beating GAME the objective is to
   shed all one's cards, in which case they are also "shedding GAME".
   Well known examples include Crazy Eights and Mau Mau.^[27]

Adding GAME[edit]

   This is a small group whose ancestor is Noddy, now extinct, but which
   generated the far more interesting GAME of Costly Colours and
   Cribbage. Players play in turn and add the values of the cards as they
   go. The aim is to reach or avoid certain totals and also to score for
   certain combinations.^[28]

Fishing GAME[edit]

   "Fishing GAME" redirects here. For the video GAME genre, see fishing
   video GAME.

   In fishing GAME, cards from the hand are played against cards in a
   layout on the table, capturing table cards if they match.^[29] Fishing
   GAME are popular in many nations, including China, where there are
   many diverse fishing GAME. Scopa is considered one of the national
   card GAME of Italy. Cassino is the only fishing GAME to be widely
   played in English-speaking countries. Zwicker has been described as a
   "simpler and jollier version of Cassino", played in Germany.^[30]
   Tablanet (tablić) is a fishing-style GAME popular in Balkans.

Matching GAME[edit]

   Main article: Matching GAME

   The object of a matching (or sometimes "melding") GAME is to acquire
   particular groups of matching cards before an opponent can do so. In
   Rummy, this is done through drawing and discarding, and the groups are
   called melds. Mahjong is a very similar GAME played with tiles instead
   of cards. Non-Rummy examples of match-type GAME generally fall into
   the "fishing" genre and include the children's GAME Go Fish and Old
   Maid.

War group[edit]

   In GAME of the war group,^[31] also called "catch and collect GAME"
   or "accumulating GAME", the object is to acquire all cards in the
   deck. Examples include most War type GAME, and GAME involving
   slapping a discard pile such as Slapjack. Egyptian Ratscrew has both of
   these features.

Climbing GAME[edit]

   Climbing GAME are an Oriental family in which the idea is to play a
   higher card or combination of cards that the one just played.
   Alternatively a player must pass or may choose to pass even if able to
   beat. The sole Western example is the GAME of President, which is
   probably derived from an Asian GAME.^[32]

Card exchange GAME[edit]

   Card exchange GAME form another large category in which players
   exchange a card or cards from their hands with table cards or with
   other players with the aim, typically, of collecting specific cards or
   card combinations. GAME of the rummy family are the best known.

Draw and discard group[edit]

   In these GAME players draw a card from stock, make a move if possible
   or desired, and then discard a card to a discard pile. Almost all the
   GAME of this group are in the rummy family, but Golf is a non-rummy
   example.^[33]

Commerce group[edit]

   As the name might suggest, players exchange hand cards with a common
   pool of cards on the table. Examples include Schwimmen, Kemps. James
   Bond and Whisky Poker. They originated in the old European GAME of
   Thirty-One and Commerce.

Cuckoo group[edit]

   A very old round GAME played in different forms in different countries.
   Players are dealt just one card and may try and swap it with a
   neighbour to avoid having the lowest card or, sometimes, certain
   penalty cards. The old French GAME is Coucou and its later English
   cousin is Ranter Go Round, also called Chase the Ace and Screw Your
   Neighbour.

   A family of such GAME played with special cards includes Italian Cucù,
   Scandinavian Gnav, Austrian Hexenspiel and German Vogelspiel.

Quartet group[edit]

   GAME involving collecting sets of cards, the best known of which is
   Happy Families. Highly successful is its German equivalent, Quartett,
   which may be played with a Skat pack, but is much more commonly played
   with proprietary packs.

Card passing group[edit]

   GAME involving passing cards to your neighbours. The classic GAME is
   Old Maid which may, however, be derived from German Black Peter and
   related to the French GAME of Vieux Garçon. Pig, with its variations of
   Donkey and Spoons, is also popular.

Layout GAME[edit]

Patience or solitaire GAME[edit]

   See also: Patience and solitaire GAME

   Most patience or card solitaire GAME are designed to be played by one
   player, but some are designed for two or more players to compete.^[25]

Single player patiences or solitaires[edit]

   Patience GAME originated in northern Europe and were designed for a
   single player, hence its subsequent North American name of solitaire.
   Most GAME begin with a specific layout of cards, called a tableau, and
   the object is then either to construct a more elaborate final layout,
   or to clear the tableau and/or the draw pile or stock by moving all
   cards to one or more discard or foundation piles.^[25]

Competitive patiences[edit]

   In competitive patiences, two or more players compete to be first to
   complete a patience or solitaire-like tableau. Some use a common
   layout; in others each player has a separate layout.^[25] Popular
   examples include Spite and Malice, Racing Demon or Nerts, Spit, Speed
   and Russian Bank.^[34]

Connecting GAME[edit]

   The most common of these is Card Dominoes also known as Fan Tan or
   Parliament in which the idea is to build the four suits in sequence
   from a central card (the 7 in 52-card GAME or the Unter in 32-card
   packs). The winner is the first out and the loser the last left in
   holding cards.^[25]

Hand comparison GAME[edit]

   Hand comparison GAME, also called comparing card GAME, are mostly
   gambling GAME that use cards. Players lay their initial stakes, are
   dealt cards, may or may not be able to exchange or add to them, and may
   or may not be able to raise their stakes, and the outcome is decided by
   some form of comparison of card values or combinations. The main groups
   are vying and banking GAME. A smaller mainly Oriental group are
   partition GAME in which players divide their hands before comparing.

Vying GAME[edit]

   Vying GAME, are those in which players bet or "vie" on who has the
   best hand. The player with the best combination of hand cards in a
   "showdown", or the player able to bluff the others into folding, wins
   the hand. Easily the best known of the group around the world is Poker,
   which itself is a family of GAME with over 100 variants. Other
   examples include English Brag and the old Basque GAME of Mus. Most may
   be classified as gambling GAME and, while they may involve skill in
   terms of bluffing and memorising and assessing odds, they involve
   little or no card playing skill.^[35]

Poker GAME[edit]

   See also: List of poker variants

   Poker is a family of gambling GAME in which players bet into a pool,
   called the pot, the value of which changes as the GAME progresses that
   the value of the hand they carry will beat all others according to the
   ranking system. Variants largely differ on how cards are dealt and the
   methods by which players can improve a hand. For many reasons,
   including its age and its popularity among Western militaries, it is
   one of the most universally known card GAME in existence.

Banking GAME[edit]

   These are gambling GAME played for money or chips in which players
   compete, not against one another, but against a banker. They are
   commonly played in casinos, but many have become domesticised, played
   at home for sweets, matchsticks or points. In casino GAME, the banker
   will have a 'house advantage' that ensures a profit for the casino.
   Popular casino GAME include Blackjack and Baccarat, while Pontoon is a
   cousin of Blackjack that emerged from the trenches of the First World
   War to become a popular British family GAME.^[36]

Miscellaneous GAME[edit]

   These GAME do not fit into any of the foregoing categories. The only
   traditional GAME in this group are the compendium GAME, which date
   back at least 200 years, and Speculation, a 19th century trading GAME.

Compendium GAME[edit]

   Compendium GAME consist of a sequence of different contracts played in
   succession. A common pattern is for a number of reverse deals to be
   played, in which the aim is to avoid certain cards, followed by a final
   contract which is a domino-type GAME. Examples include: Barbu, Herzeln,
   Lorum and Rosbiratschka. In other GAME, such as Quodlibet and Rumpel,
   there is a range of widely varying contracts.

Combat GAME[edit]

   A new genre not recorded before 1970, most of which use proprietary
   cards of the collectible card GAME type (see below). The earliest and
   best known is Magic: The Gathering.

Card GAME by objective[edit]

   Another broad way of classifying card GAME is by objective. There are
   four main types as well as a handful of GAME that have miscellaneous
   objectives.

Capturing GAME[edit]

   In these GAME the objective is to capture cards or to avoid capturing
   them. These break down into the following:^[37]
     * Most cards. The aim is to capture as many cards as possible. Most
       plain trick GAME fall into this group.
     * Fewest cards. Common in compendium GAME, otherwise rare. Often
       occurs as a contract within a GAME known as a Misère, Bettel, Null
       or Nolo.
     * Exact number of cards. To win GAME of the exact bidding group a
       player must take the exact number of tricks bid.
     * Most points. In point-trick GAME and most fishing GAME, the aim
       is to capture the most points in cards.
     * Fewest points. Some or all cards incur penalty points and so the
       aim is to capture as few points as possible.
     * Exact points. A small group in which players aim to score a
       specific number of points e.g. Differenzler Jass.
     * Most or fewest points. In some Jass GAME e.g. Molotov, the aim is
       to secure either the most or fewest points, leaving the player in
       the middle as the loser.
     * Win last trick. In GAME like Tuppen, the player who takes the last
       trick wins; all earlier tricks are irrelevant. Some GAME also have
       a bonus or extra points for winning the last trick or winning it
       with a specific card.
     * Lose last trick. In a few GAME, e.g. Krypkille, the aim is to lose
       the last trick.
     * Mixed objectives. Some GAME, e.g. Kaiser, have both positive and
       negative point cards.

Shedding GAME[edit]

   See also: List of shedding-type GAME

   In a shedding GAME, also called an accumulating GAME, players start
   with a hand of cards, and the object of the GAME is to be the first
   player to discard all cards from one's hand. Common shedding GAME
   include Crazy Eights (commercialized by Mattel as Uno) and Daihinmin.
   Some matching-type GAME are also shedding-type GAME; some variants of
   Rummy such as Paskahousu, Phase 10, Rummikub, the bluffing GAME I Doubt
   It, and the children's GAME Musta Maija and Old Maid, fall into both
   categories.

  Combination GAME[edit]

   In many GAME, the aim is to form combinations of cards: by addition,
   by matching sets or forming sequences. All Rummy GAME are based on the
   last two principles, although in the basic variants, the end objective
   is to shed cards which makes them shedding GAME (see above). However,
   meld scoring variants such as Canasta or Rommé are true combination
   GAME.^[38]

  Comparing GAME[edit]

   Comparing card GAME are those where hand values are compared to
   determine the winner, also known as "vying" or "showdown" GAME. Poker,
   blackjack, mus, and baccarat are examples of comparing card GAME. As
   seen, nearly all of these GAME are designed as gambling GAME.

Drinking GAME[edit]

   Drinking card GAME are drinking GAME using cards, in which the object
   in playing the GAME is either to drink or to force others to drink.
   Many GAME are ordinary card GAME with the establishment of "drinking
   rules"; President, for instance, is virtually identical to Daihinmin
   but with additional rules governing drinking. Poker can also be played
   using a number of drinks as the wager. Another GAME often played as a
   drinking GAME is Toepen, quite popular in the Netherlands. Some card
   GAME are designed specifically to be played as drinking GAME.

Proprietary GAME[edit]

   These are card GAME played with a dedicated deck. Many other card
   GAME have been designed and published on a commercial or amateur
   basis. In a few cases, the GAME uses the standard 52-card deck, but the
   object is unique. In Eleusis, for example, players play single cards,
   and are told whether the play was legal or illegal, in an attempt to
   discover the underlying rules made up by the dealer.

   Most of these GAME however typically use a specially made deck of
   cards designed specifically for the GAME (or variations of it). The
   decks are thus usually proprietary, but may be created by the GAME's
   players. Uno, Phase 10, Set, and 1000 Blank White Cards are popular
   dedicated-deck card GAME; 1000 Blank White Cards is unique in that the
   cards for the GAME are designed by the players of the GAME while
   playing it; there is no commercially available deck advertised as such.

  Collectible card GAME (CCGs)[edit]

   See also: Collectible card GAME and List of collectible card GAME

   Collectible card GAME (CCG) are proprietary playing card GAME. CCGs
   are GAME of strategy between two or more players. Each player has
   their own deck constructed from a very large pool of unique cards in
   the commercial market. The cards have different effects, costs, and
   art. New card sets are released periodically and sold as starter decks
   or booster packs. Obtaining the different cards makes the GAME a
   collectible card GAME, and cards are sold or traded on the secondary
   market. Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon, and Yu-Gi-Oh! are well-known
   collectible card GAME.

  Living card GAME (LCGs)[edit]

   See also: Living card GAME and Fantasy Flight GAME

   Living card GAME (LCGs) are similar to collectible card GAME (CCGs),
   with their most distinguishing feature being a fixed distribution
   method, which breaks away from the traditional collectible card GAME
   format. While new cards for CCGs are usually sold in the form of
   starter decks or booster packs (the latter being often randomized),
   LCGs thrive on a model that requires players to acquire one core set in
   order to play the GAME, which players can further customize by
   acquiring extra sets or expansions featuring new content in the form of
   cards or scenarios. No randomization is involved in the process, thus
   players that get the same sets or expansions will get the exact same
   content. The term was popularized by Fantasy Flight GAME (FFG) and
   mainly applies to its products, however some tabletop gaming companies
   can be seen using a very similar model.

  Simulation card GAME[edit]

   A deck of either customised dedicated cards or a standard deck of
   playing cards with assigned meanings is used to simulate the actions of
   another activity, for example card football.

Fictional card GAME[edit]

   See also: List of fictional GAME § Card GAME

   Many GAME, including card GAME, are fabricated by science fiction
   authors and screenwriters to distance a culture depicted in the story
   from present-day Western culture. They are commonly used as filler to
   depict background activities in an atmosphere like a bar or rec room,
   but sometimes the drama revolves around the play of the GAME. Some of
   these GAME become real card GAME as the holder of the intellectual
   property develops and markets a suitable deck and ruleset for the GAME,
   while others lack sufficient descriptions of rules, or depend on cards
   or other hardware that are infeasible or physically impossible.

  Number and association of players[edit]

   t%2C_London.jpg] The Card Players, 1895 by Paul
   Cézanne[220px-Card_GAME%2C_circa_1930s.jpg] Historically, card GAME
   such as whist and contract bridge were opportunities for quiet
   socializing, as shown in this 1930s magic lantern slide photo taken in
   Seattle, Washington.

   Any specific card GAME imposes restrictions on the number of players.
   The most significant dividing lines run between one-player GAME and
   two-player GAME, and between two-player GAME and multi-player GAME.
   Card GAME for one player are known as solitaire or patience card
   GAME. (See list of solitaire card GAME.) Generally speaking, they are
   in many ways special and atypical, although some of them have given
   rise to two- or multi-player GAME such as Spite and Malice.

   In card GAME for two players, usually not all cards are distributed to
   the players, as they would otherwise have perfect information about the
   GAME state. Two-player GAME have always been immensely popular and
   include some of the most significant card GAME such as piquet,
   bezique, sixty-six, klaberjass, gin rummy and cribbage. Many
   multi-player GAME started as two-player GAME that were adapted to a
   greater number of players. For such adaptations a number of non-obvious
   choices must be made beginning with the choice of a GAME orientation.

   One way of extending a two-player GAME to more players is by building
   two teams of equal size. A common case is four players in two fixed
   partnerships, sitting crosswise as in whist and contract bridge.
   Partners sit opposite to each other and cannot see each other's hands.
   If communication between the partners is allowed at all, then it is
   usually restricted to a specific list of permitted signs and signals.
   17th-century French partnership GAME such as triomphe were special in
   that partners sat next to each other and were allowed to communicate
   freely so long as they did not exchange cards or play out of order.

   Another way of extending a two-player GAME to more players is as a
   cut-throat or individual GAME, in which all players play for
   themselves, and win or lose alone. Most such card GAME are round
   GAME, i.e. they can be played by any number of players starting from
   two or three, so long as there are enough cards for all.

   For some of the most interesting GAME such as ombre, tarot and skat,
   the associations between players change from hand to hand. Ultimately
   players all play on their own, but for each hand, some GAME mechanism
   divides the players into two teams. Most typically these are solo
   GAME, i.e. GAME in which one player becomes the soloist and has to
   achieve some objective against the others, who form a team and win or
   lose all their points jointly. But in GAME for more than three
   players, there may also be a mechanism that selects two players who
   then have to play against the others.

  Direction of play[edit]

   The players of a card GAME normally form a circle around a table or
   other space that can hold cards. The GAME orientation or direction of
   play, which is only relevant for three or more players, can be either
   clockwise or counterclockwise. It is the direction in which various
   roles in the GAME proceed. (In real-time card GAME, there may be no
   need for a direction of play.) Most regions have a traditional
   direction of play, such as:
     * Counterclockwise in most of Asia and in Latin America.
     * Clockwise in North America and Australia.

   Europe is roughly divided into a clockwise area in the north and a
   counterclockwise area in the south. The boundary runs between England,
   Ireland, Netherlands, Germany, Austria (mostly), Slovakia, Ukraine and
   Russia (clockwise) and France, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Slovenia,
   Balkans, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey
   (counterclockwise).^[specify]^[citation needed]

   GAME that originate in a region with a strong preference are often
   initially played in the original direction, even in regions that prefer
   the opposite direction. For GAME that have official rules and are
   played in tournaments, the direction of play is often prescribed in
   those rules.

  Determining who deals[edit]

   Most GAME have some form of asymmetry between players. The roles of
   players are normally expressed in terms of the dealer, i.e. the player
   whose task it is to shuffle the cards and distribute them to the
   players. Being the dealer can be a (minor or major) advantage or
   disadvantage, depending on the GAME. Therefore, after each played hand,
   the deal normally passes to the next player according to the GAME
   orientation.

   As it can still be an advantage or disadvantage to be the first dealer,
   there are some standard methods for determining who is the first
   dealer. A common method is by cutting, which works as follows. One
   player shuffles the deck and places it on the table. Each player lifts
   a packet of cards from the top, reveals its bottom card, and returns it
   to the deck. The player who reveals the highest (or lowest) card
   becomes dealer. In the case of a tie, the process is repeated by the
   tied players. For some GAME such as whist this process of cutting is
   part of the official rules, and the hierarchy of cards for the purpose
   of cutting (which need not be the same as that used otherwise in the
   GAME) is also specified. But in general, any method can be used, such
   as tossing a coin in case of a two-player GAME, drawing cards until one
   player draws an ace, or rolling dice.

  Hands, rounds and GAME[edit]

   A hand, also called a deal, is a unit of the GAME that begins with the
   dealer shuffling and dealing the cards as described below, and ends
   with the players scoring and the next dealer being determined. The set
   of cards that each player receives and holds in his or her hands is
   also known as that player's hand.

   The hand is over when the players have finished playing their hands.
   Most often this occurs when one player (or all) has no cards left. The
   player who sits after the dealer in the direction of play is known as
   eldest hand (or in two-player GAME as elder hand) or forehand. A GAME
   round consists of as many hands as there are players. After each hand,
   the deal is passed on in the direction of play, i.e. the previous
   eldest hand becomes the new dealer. Normally players score points after
   each hand. A GAME may consist of a fixed number of rounds.
   Alternatively it can be played for a fixed number of points. In this
   case it is over with the hand in which a player reaches the target
   score.

  Shuffling[edit]

   Main article: Shuffling

   Shuffling is the process of bringing the cards of a pack into a random
   order. There are a large number of techniques with various advantages
   and disadvantages. Riffle shuffling is a method in which the deck is
   divided into two roughly equal-sized halves that are bent and then
   released, so that the cards interlace.^[39] Repeating this process
   several times randomizes the deck well, but the method is harder to
   learn than some others and may damage the cards. The overhand shuffle
   and the Hindu shuffle are two techniques that work by taking batches of
   cards from the top of the deck and reassembling them in the opposite
   order. They are easier to learn but must be repeated more often. A
   method suitable for small children consists in spreading the cards on a
   large surface and moving them around before picking up the deck again.
   This is also the most common method for shuffling tiles such as
   dominoes.

   For casino GAME that are played for large sums it is vital that the
   cards be properly randomized, but for many GAME this is less critical,
   and in fact player experience can suffer when the cards are shuffled
   too well. The official skat rules stipulate that the cards are shuffled
   well, but according to a decision of the German skat court, a
   one-handed player should ask another player to do the shuffling, rather
   than use a shuffling machine, as it would shuffle the cards too well.
   French belote rules go so far as to prescribe that the deck never be
   shuffled between hands.

  Dealing[edit]

   The dealer takes all of the cards in the pack, arranges them so that
   they are in a uniform stack, and shuffles them. In strict play, the
   dealer then offers the deck to the previous player (in the sense of the
   GAME direction) for cutting. If the deal is clockwise, this is the
   player to the dealer's right; if counterclockwise, it is the player to
   the dealer's left. The invitation to cut is made by placing the pack,
   face downward, on the table near the player who is to cut: who then
   lifts the upper portion of the pack clear of the lower portion and
   places it alongside. (Normally the two portions have about equal size.
   Strict rules often indicate that each portion must contain a certain
   minimum number of cards, such as three or five.) The formerly lower
   portion is then replaced on top of the formerly upper portion. Instead
   of cutting, one may also knock on the deck to indicate that one trusts
   the dealer to have shuffled fairly.

   The actual deal (distribution of cards) is done in the direction of
   play, beginning with eldest hand. The dealer holds the pack, face down,
   in one hand, and removes cards from the top of it with his or her other
   hand to distribute to the players, placing them face down on the table
   in front of the players to whom they are dealt. The cards may be dealt
   one at a time, or in batches of more than one card; and either the
   entire pack or a determined number of cards are dealt out. The undealt
   cards, if any, are left face down in the middle of the table, forming
   the stock (also called the talon, widow, skat or kitty depending on the
   GAME and region).

   Throughout the shuffle, cut, and deal, the dealer should prevent the
   players from seeing the faces of any of the cards. The players should
   not try to see any of the faces. Should a player accidentally see a
   card, other than one's own, proper etiquette would be to admit this. It
   is also dishonest to try to see cards as they are dealt, or to take
   advantage of having seen a card. Should a card accidentally become
   exposed, (visible to all), any player can demand a redeal (all the
   cards are gathered up, and the shuffle, cut, and deal are repeated) or
   that the card be replaced randomly into the deck ("burning" it) and a
   replacement dealt from the top to the player who was to receive the
   revealed card.

   When the deal is complete, all players pick up their cards, or "hand",
   and hold them in such a way that the faces can be seen by the holder of
   the cards but not the other players, or vice versa depending on the
   GAME. It is helpful to fan one's cards out so that if they have corner
   indices all their values can be seen at once. In most GAME, it is also
   useful to sort one's hand, rearranging the cards in a way appropriate
   to the GAME. For example, in a trick-taking GAME it may be easier to
   have all one's cards of the same suit together, whereas in a rummy GAME
   one might sort them by rank or by potential combinations.

Signalling[edit]

   Normally communication between partners about tactics or the cards in
   their hands is forbidden. However, in a small number of GAME
   communication and/or signalling is permitted and very much part of the
   play. Most of these GAME are very old and, often, have rules of play
   that allow any card to be played at any time. Such GAME include:
     * Karnöffel, the oldest card GAME in Europe still played in some form
       today, played with German-suited cards, and its surviving
       descendants:
          + Knüffeln (north Germany) and Styrivolt (Faroes) played with 48
            French-suited cards
          + Kaiserspiel, Swiss GAME with a Swiss-suited pack of 48 cards
     * Mus, a Basque GAME known since the 18th century, played with a
       Spanish deck of forty cards;
     * Brisca, a Spanish GAME adapted from the French Brisque, is played
       with a Spanish pack of forty cards;
     * Watten, a Bavarian and Austrian GAME, is played with 36
       German-suited cards;
     * Perlaggen, a Tyrolean GAME played with 33 German-suited cards;
     * Truc y Flou, a card GAME of Aragonese origin.
     * Trut or Truc, reported in the west of France from the 16th
       century,^[40] also known in Catalonia and South America (as Truco).

Rules[edit]

   this template message)

   A new card GAME starts in a small way, either as someone's invention,
   or as a modification of an existing GAME. Those playing it may agree to
   change the rules as they wish. The rules that they agree on become the
   "house rules" under which they play the GAME. A set of house rules may
   be accepted as valid by a group of players wherever they play, as it
   may also be accepted as governing all play within a particular house,
   café, or club.

   When a GAME becomes sufficiently popular, so that people often play it
   with strangers, there is a need for a generally accepted set of rules.
   This need is often met when a particular set of house rules becomes
   generally recognized. For example, when Whist became popular in
   18th-century England, players in the Portland Club agreed on a set of
   house rules for use on its premises. Players in some other clubs then
   agreed to follow the "Portland Club" rules, rather than go to the
   trouble of codifying and printing their own sets of rules. The Portland
   Club rules eventually became generally accepted throughout England and
   Western cultures.

   There is nothing static or "official" about this process. For the
   majority of GAME, there is no one set of universal rules by which the
   GAME is played, and the most common ruleset is no more or less than
   that. Many widely played card GAME, such as Canasta and Pinochle, have
   no official regulating body. The most common ruleset is often
   determined by the most popular distribution of rulebooks for card
   GAME. Perhaps the original compilation of popular playing card GAME
   was collected by Edmund Hoyle, a self-made authority on many popular
   parlor GAME. The U.S. Playing Card Company now owns the eponymous
   Hoyle brand, and publishes a series of rulebooks for various families
   of card GAME that have largely standardized the GAME' rules in
   countries and languages where the rulebooks are widely distributed.
   However, players are free to, and often do, invent "house rules" to
   supplement or even largely replace the "standard" rules.

   If there is a sense in which a card GAME can have an official set of
   rules, it is when that card GAME has an "official" governing body. For
   example, the rules of tournament bridge are governed by the World
   Bridge Federation, and by local bodies in various countries such as the
   American Contract Bridge League in the U.S., and the English Bridge
   Union in England. The rules of skat are governed by The International
   Skat Players Association and, in Germany, by the Deutscher Skatverband
   which publishes the Skatordnung. The rules of French tarot are governed
   by the Fédération Française de Tarot. The rules of Schafkopf are laid
   down by the Schafkopfschule in Munich. Even in these cases, the rules
   must only be followed at GAME sanctioned by these governing bodies or
   where the tournament organisers specify them. Players in informal
   settings are free to implement agreed supplemental or substitute rules.
   For example, in Schafkopf there are numerous local variants sometimes
   known as "impure" Schafkopf and specified by assuming the official
   rules and describing the additions e.g. "with Geier and Bettel, tariff
   5/10 cents".

  Rule infractions[edit]

   An infraction is any action which is against the rules of the GAME,
   such as playing a card when it is not one's turn to play or the
   accidental exposure of a card, informally known as "bleeding."

   In many official sets of rules for card GAME, the rules specifying the
   penalties for various infractions occupy more pages than the rules
   specifying how to play correctly. This is tedious but necessary for
   GAME that are played seriously. Players who intend to play a card GAME
   at a high level generally ensure before beginning that all agree on the
   penalties to be used. When playing privately, this will normally be a
   question of agreeing house rules. In a tournament, there will probably
   be a tournament director who will enforce the rules when required and
   arbitrate in cases of doubt.

   If a player breaks the rules of a GAME deliberately, this is cheating.
   The rest of this section is therefore about accidental infractions,
   caused by ignorance, clumsiness, inattention, etc.

   As the same GAME is played repeatedly among a group of players,
   precedents build up about how a particular infraction of the rules
   should be handled. For example, "Sheila just led a card when it wasn't
   her turn. Last week when Jo did that, we agreed ... etc." Sets of such
   precedents tend to become established among groups of players, and to
   be regarded as part of the house rules. Sets of house rules may become
   formalized, as described in the previous section. Therefore, for some
   GAME, there is a "proper" way of handling infractions of the rules.
   But for many GAME, without governing bodies, there is no standard way
   of handling infractions.

   In many circumstances, there is no need for special rules dealing with
   what happens after an infraction. As a general principle, the person
   who broke a rule should not benefit from it, and the other players
   should not lose by it. An exception to this may be made in GAME with
   fixed partnerships, in which it may be felt that the partner(s) of the
   person who broke a rule should also not benefit. The penalty for an
   accidental infraction should be as mild as reasonable, consistent with
   there being a possible benefit to the person responsible.

   dated c. 1400 AD, Ming dynasty

   The oldest surviving reference to the card GAME in world history is
   from the 9th century China, when the Collection of Miscellanea at
   Duyang, written by Tang-dynasty writer Su E, described Princess
   Tongchang (daughter of Emperor Yizong of Tang) playing the "leaf GAME"
   with members of the Wei clan (the family of the princess's husband) in
   868 .^[41]^[42]^[43] The Song dynasty statesman and historian Ouyang
   Xiu has noted that paper playing cards arose in connection to an
   earlier development in the book format from scrolls to pages.^[41]
   [Mamluk_playing_card_7.jpg] Mamluk playing card (king of cups), c.15th
   century

   Playing cards first appeared in Europe in the last quarter of the 14th
   century.^[44]^: 35  The earliest European references speak of a Saracen
   or Moorish GAME called naib, and in fact an almost complete Mamluk
   Egyptian deck of 52 cards in a distinct oriental design has survived
   from around the same time, with the four suits swords, polo sticks,
   cups and coins and the ranks king, governor, second governor, and ten
   to one.^[44]^: 40f ^[45]

   The 1430s in Italy saw the invention of the tarot deck, a full
   Latin-suited deck augmented by suitless cards with painted motifs that
   played a special role as trumps. Tarot card GAME are still played with
   (subsets of) these decks in parts of Central Europe. A full tarot deck
   contains 14 cards in each suit; low cards labeled 1–10, and court cards
   valet (jack), chevalier (cavalier/knight), dame (queen), and roi
   (king), plus the fool or excuse card, and 21 trump cards. In the 18th
   century the card images of the traditional Italian tarot decks became
   popular in cartomancy and evolved into "esoteric" decks used primarily
   for the purpose; today most tarot decks sold in North America are the
   occult type, and are closely associated with fortune telling. In
   Europe, "playing tarot" decks remain popular for GAME, and have
   evolved since the 18th century to use regional suits (spades, hearts,
   diamonds and clubs in France; leaves, hearts, bells and acorns in
   Germany) as well as other familiar aspects of the English-pattern pack
   such as corner card indices and "stamped" card symbols for non-court
   cards. Decks differ regionally based on the number of cards needed to
   play the GAME; the French tarot consists of the "full" 78 cards, while
   Germanic, Spanish and Italian Tarot variants remove certain values
   (usually low suited cards) from the deck, creating a deck with as few
   as 32 cards.

   The French suits were introduced around 1480 and, in France, mostly
   replaced the earlier Latin suits of swords, clubs, cups and
   coins.^[44]^: 43  (which are still common in Spanish- and
   Portuguese-speaking countries as well as in some northern regions of
   Italy)^[44]^: 30f  The suit symbols, being very simple and
   single-color, could be stamped onto the playing cards to create a deck,
   thus only requiring special full-color card art for the court cards.
   This drastically simplifies the production of a deck of cards versus
   the traditional Italian deck, which used unique full-color art for each
   card in the deck. The French suits became popular in English playing
   cards in the 16th century (despite historic animosity between France
   and England), and from there were introduced to British colonies
   including North America. The rise of Western culture has led to the
   near-universal popularity and availability of French-suited playing
   cards even in areas with their own regional card art.

   In Japan, a distinct 48-card hanafuda deck is popular. It is derived
   from 16th-century Portuguese decks, after undergoing a long evolution
   driven by laws enacted by the Tokugawa shogunate attempting to ban the
   use of playing cards

   The best-known deck internationally is the English pattern of the
   52-card French deck, also called the International or Anglo-American
   pattern, used for such GAME as poker and contract bridge. It contains
   one card for each unique combination of thirteen ranks and the four
   French suits spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. The ranks (from
   highest to lowest in bridge and poker) are ace, king, queen, jack (or
   knave), and the numbers from ten down to two (or deuce). The trump
   cards and knight cards from the French playing tarot are not included.

   Originally the term knave was more common than "jack"; the card had
   been called a jack as part of the terminology of All-Fours since the
   17th century, but the word was considered vulgar. (Note the exclamation
   by Estella in Charles Dickens's novel Great Expectations: "He calls the
   knaves, Jacks, this boy!") However, because the card abbreviation for
   knave ("Kn") was so close to that of the king, it was very easy to
   confuse them, especially after suits and rankings were moved to the
   corners of the card in order to enable people to fan them in one hand
   and still see all the values. (The earliest known deck to place suits
   and rankings in the corner of the card is from 1693, but these cards
   did not become common until after 1864 when Hart reintroduced them
   along with the knave-to-jack change.) However, books of card GAME
   published in the third quarter of the 19th century evidently still
   referred to the "knave", and the term with this definition is still
   recognized in the United Kingdom.
   [220px-Chinese_Mother_Of_Pearl_Gambling_Tokens.jpg] Chinese
   mother-of-pearl gambling tokens used in scoring and bidding of card
   GAME.

   In the 17th century, a French, five-trick, gambling GAME called Bête
   became popular and spread to Germany, where it was called La Bete and
   England where it was named Beast. It was a derivative of Triomphe and
   was the first card GAME in history to introduce the concept of
   bidding.^[46]

   Chinese handmade mother-of-pearl gaming counters were used in scoring
   and bidding of card GAME in the West during the approximate period of
   1700–1840. The gaming counters would bear an engraving such as a coat
   of arms or a monogram to identify a family or individual. Many of the
   gaming counters also depict Chinese scenes, flowers or animals. Queen
   Charlotte is one prominent British individual who is known to have
   played with the Chinese gaming counters. Card GAME such as Ombre,
   Quadrille and Pope Joan were popular at the time and required counters
   for scoring. The production of counters declined after Whist, with its
   different scoring method, became the most popular card GAME in the
   West.^[47]

   Based on the association of card GAME and gambling, Pope Benedict XIV
   banned card GAME on October 17, 1750.^[48]

   Forms of competitive activity, usually physical
   For other uses, see Sport (disambiguation).

   [300px-Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg] Sport in childhood. Association
   football, shown above, is a team sport which also provides
   opportunities to nurture physical fitness and social interaction
   skills.[220px-London_Marathon_2005_at_Blackfriars.jpg] The 2005 London
   Marathon: running races, in their various specialties, represent the
   oldest and most traditional form of sport.

   Sport pertains to any form of physical activity or GAME,^[1] often
   competitive and organized, that aims to use, maintain, or improve
   physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants
   and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators.^[2] Sports can,
   through casual or organized participation, improve participants'
   physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single
   contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous
   participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain
   sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or
   consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is
   between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports
   allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others
   provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner. A number of contests
   may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports
   leagues make an annual champion by arranging GAME in a regular sports
   season, followed in some cases by playoffs.

   Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical
   athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions such as the
   Olympic GAME admitting only sports meeting this definition.^[3] Other
   organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities
   without a physical element from classification as sports.^[2] However,
   a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition
   as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF)
   recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord,
   the international sports federation association, recognises five
   non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and
   xiangqi,^[4]^[5] and limits the number of mind GAME which can be
   admitted as sports.^[1]

   Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to
   ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the
   winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring
   goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who
   are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective
   or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic
   impression.

   Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this
   information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is
   also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with
   spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching
   wider audiences through broadcasting. Sport betting is in some cases
   severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.

   According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry
   is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013.^[6] The world's most accessible
   and practised sport is running, while association football is the most
   popular spectator sport.^[7]

Meaning and usage

Etymology

   The word "sport" comes from the Old French desport meaning "leisure",
   with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being "anything
   humans find amusing or entertaining".^[8]

   Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of
   gambling; hunting; and GAME and diversions, including ones that
   require exercise.^[9] Roget's defines the noun sport as an "activity
   engaged in for relaxation and amusement" with synonyms including
   diversion and recreation.^[10]

Nomenclature

   The singular term "sport" is used in most English dialects to describe
   the overall concept (e.g. "children taking part in sport"), with
   "sports" used to describe multiple activities (e.g. "football and rugby
   are the most popular sports in England"). American English uses
   "sports" for both terms.

Definition

   See also: GAME § Definitions
   [200px-ChessStartingPosition.jpg] The International Olympic Committee
   recognises some board GAME as sports, including
   chess.[200px-Showjumping_white_horse.jpg] Show jumping, an equestrian
   sport

   The precise definition of what differentiates a sport from other
   leisure activities varies between sources. The closest to an
   international agreement on a definition is provided by the Global
   Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF), which is the
   association for all the largest international sports federations
   (including association football, athletics, cycling, tennis, equestrian
   sports, and more), and is therefore the de facto representative of
   international sport.

   GAISF uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:^[1]
     * have an element of competition
     * be in no way harmful to any living creature
     * not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding
       proprietary GAME such as arena football)
     * not rely on any "luck" element specifically designed into the
       sport.

   They also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as rugby
   or athletics), primarily mind (such as chess or Go), predominantly
   motorised (such as Formula 1 or powerboating), primarily co-ordination
   (such as billiard sports), or primarily animal-supported (such as
   equestrian sport).^[1]

   The inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been
   universally accepted, leading to legal challenges from governing bodies
   in regards to being denied funding available to sports.^[11] Whilst
   GAISF recognises a small number of mind sports, it is not open to
   admitting any further mind sports.

   There has been an increase in the application of the term "sport" to a
   wider set of non-physical challenges such as video GAME, also called
   esports (from "electronic sports"), especially due to the large scale
   of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely
   recognised by mainstream sports organisations. According to Council of
   Europe, European Sports Charter, article 2.i, "'Sport' means all forms
   of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation,
   aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being,
   forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all
   levels."^[12]

Competition

   [220px-Horse-racing-4.jpg] Horse racing

   There are opposing views on the necessity of competition as a defining
   element of a sport, with almost all professional sports involving
   competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a
   prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee
   (IOC) or GAISF.^[1]

   Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all
   physical activity. For instance, the Council of Europe include all
   forms of physical exercise, including those competed just for fun.

   In order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on
   less able participants, there has been an introduction of
   non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events
   such as school sports days, although moves like this are often
   controversial.^[13]^[14]

   In competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on
   their "result" and often divided into groups of comparable performance,
   (e.g. gender, weight and age). The measurement of the result may be
   objective or subjective, and corrected with "handicaps" or penalties.
   In a race, for example, the time to complete the course is an objective
   measurement. In gymnastics or diving the result is decided by a panel
   of judges, and therefore subjective. There are many shades of judging
   between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by
   judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time.

   Artifacts and structures suggest sport in China as early as 2000
   BC.^[15] Gymnastics appears to have been popular in China's ancient
   past. Monuments to the Pharaohs indicate that a number of sports,
   including swimming and fishing, were well-developed and regulated
   several thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt.^[16] Other Egyptian
   sports included javelin throwing, high jump, and wrestling. Ancient
   Persian sports such as the traditional Iranian martial art of
   Zoorkhaneh had a close connection to warfare skills.^[17] Among other
   sports that originated in ancient Persia are polo and jousting. The
   traditional South Asian sport of kabaddi has been played for thousands
   of years, potentially as a preparation for hunting.^[18]
   [200px-Bruno_Senna_2006_Australian_Grand_Prix.jpg] Motorised sports
   have appeared since the advent of the modern age.

   A wide range of sports were already established by the time of Ancient
   Greece and the military culture and the development of sport in Greece
   influenced one another considerably. Sport became such a prominent part
   of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic GAME, which in
   ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the
   Peloponnesus called Olympia.^[19]

   Sports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of
   the ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialisation has
   brought motorised transportation and increased leisure time, letting
   people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic
   activities. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and
   global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding
   to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans followed the
   exploits of professional athletes – all while enjoying the exercise and
   competition associated with amateur participation in sports. Since the
   turn of the 21st century, there has been increasing debate about
   whether transgender sports people should be able to participate in
   sport events that conform with their post-transition gender
   identity.^[20]

Fair play

Sportsmanship

   Main article: Sportsmanship
   See also: GAMEmanship and Winning isn't everything; it's the only
   thing

   Sportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy
   toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and
   grace in victory or defeat.^[21]^[22]^[23]

   Sportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will
   be enjoyed for its own sake. The well-known sentiment by sports
   journalist Grantland Rice, that it is "not that you won or lost but how
   you played the GAME", and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its
   founder Pierre de Coubertin: "The most important thing... is not
   winning but taking part" are typical expressions of this sentiment.

Cheating

   See also: Match fixing and cheating

   Key principles of sport include that the result should not be
   predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to
   win. Rules are in place to ensure fair play, but participants can break
   these rules in order to gain advantage.

   Participants may cheat in order to unfairly increase their chance of
   winning, or in order to achieve other advantages such as financial
   gains. The widespread existence of gambling on the results of sports
   events creates a motivation for match fixing, where a participant or
   participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome rather than
   simply playing to win.

Doping and drugs

   Main article: Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport

   The competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt
   to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through
   other means such as increasing the volume of blood in their bodies
   through artificial means.

   All sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to
   implement a testing programme, looking for a list of banned drugs, with
   suspensions or bans being placed on participants who test positive for
   banned substances.

  Violence

   Violence in sports involves crossing the line between fair competition
   and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, fans, and
   parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in
   misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration. Rioting
   or hooliganism by fans in particular is a problem at some national and
   international sporting contests.^[citation needed]

Participation

  Gender participation

   ners_-_ISTAF_2006_-_Berlin%2C_3_September.jpg] International level
   female athletes at ISTAF Berlin, 2006

   Female participation in sports continues to rise alongside the
   opportunity for involvement and the value of sports for child
   development and physical fitness. Despite increases in female
   participation during the last three decades, a gap persists in the
   enrolment figures between male and female players in sports-related
   teams. Female players account for 39% of the total participation in US
   interscholastic athletics.

   Certain sports are mixed-gender, allowing (or even requiring) men and
   women to play on the same team. One example of this is Baseball5, which
   is the first mixed-gender sport to have been admitted into an Olympic
   event.^[24]

  Youth participation

   See also: College sports

   Youth sport presents children with opportunities for fun,
   socialisation, forming peer relationships, physical fitness, and
   athletic scholarships. Activists for education and the war on drugs
   encourage youth sport as a means to increase educational participation
   and to fight the illegal drug trade. According to the Center for Injury
   Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital, the biggest risk
   for youth sport is death or serious injury including concussion. These
   risks come from running, basketball, association football, volleyball,
   gridiron, gymnastics, and ice hockey.^[25] Youth sport in the US is a
   $15 billion industry including equipment up to private coaching.^[26]

  Disabled participation

   See also: Parasports

   [220px-David_Bizet_-_Marathon_de_Paris_2014.jpg] A runner gives a
   friendly tap on the shoulder to a wheelchair racer during the Marathon
   International de Paris (Paris Marathon) in 2014.

   Disabled sports also adaptive sports or parasports, are sports played
   by people with a disability, including physical and intellectual
   disabilities. As many of these are based on existing sports modified to
   meet the needs of people with a disability, they are sometimes referred
   to as adapted sports. However, not all disabled sports are adapted;
   several sports that have been specifically created for people with a
   disability have no equivalent in able-bodied sports.

  Spectator involvement

   Main article: Spectator sport

   [220px-1906_Athens_stadium.jpg] Spectators at the 1906 unofficial
   Olympic GAME

   The competition element of sport, along with the aesthetic appeal of
   some sports, result in the popularity of people attending to watch
   sport being played. This has led to the specific phenomenon of
   spectator sport.

   Both amateur and professional sports attract spectators, both in person
   at the sport venue, and through broadcast media including radio,
   television and internet broadcast. Both attendance in person and
   viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge, such as an
   entrance ticket, or pay-per-view television broadcast. Sports league
   and tournament are two common arrangements to organise sport teams or
   individual athletes into competing against each other continuously or
   periodically.

   It is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences,
   leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the
   rights to show certain events. The football World Cup attracts a global
   television audience of hundreds of millions; the 2006 final alone
   attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700 million and
   the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final attracted an estimated audience of
   135 million in India alone.^[27]

   In the United States, the championship GAME of the NFL, the Super Bowl,
   has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the
   year.^[28]^[29] Super Bowl Sunday is a de facto national holiday in
   America;^[30]^[31] the viewership being so great that in 2015,
   advertising space was reported as being sold at $4.5m for a 30-second
   slot.^[28]

Amateur and professional

   See also: Professional sport and Amateur sport

   [220px-Volleyball-5_%289786053885%29.jpg] Women's volleyball team of a
   U.S. university

   Sport can be undertaken on an amateur, professional or
   semi-professional basis, depending on whether participants are
   incentivised for participation (usually through payment of a wage or
   salary). Amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called
   "grassroots sport".^[2]^[32]

   The popularity of spectator sport as a recreation for non-participants
   has led to sport becoming a major business in its own right, and this
   has incentivised a high paying professional sport culture, where high
   performing participants are rewarded with pay far in excess of average
   wages, which can run into millions of dollars.^[33]

   Some sports, or individual competitions within a sport, retain a policy
   of allowing only amateur sport. The Olympic GAME started with a
   principle of amateur competition with those who practised a sport
   professionally considered to have an unfair advantage over those who
   practised it merely as a hobby.^[34] From 1971, Olympic athletes were
   allowed to receive compensation and sponsorship,^[35] and from 1986,
   the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the
   Olympics,^[35]^[36] with the exceptions of boxing,^[37]^[38] and
   wrestling.^[39]^[40]

Technology

   [220px-Third_umpire_lights_at_Melbourne_Cricket_Ground.JPG] These
   lights at the Melbourne Cricket Ground indicate the decision the third
   umpire makes following a review.

   Technology plays an important part in modern sport. It is a necessary
   part of some sports (such as motorsport), and it is used in others to
   improve performance. Some sports also use it to allow off-field
   decision making.

   Sports science is a widespread academic discipline, and can be applied
   to areas including athlete performance, such as the use of video
   analysis to fine-tune technique, or to equipment, such as improved
   running shoes or competitive swimwear. Sports engineering emerged as a
   discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not just on materials
   design but also the use of technology in sport, from analytics and big
   data to wearable technology.^[41] In order to control the impact of
   technology on fair play, governing bodies frequently have specific
   rules that are set to control the impact of technical advantage between
   participants. For example, in 2010, full-body, non-textile swimsuits
   were banned by FINA, as they were enhancing swimmers'
   performances.^[42]^[43]

   The increase in technology has also allowed many decisions in sports
   matches to be taken, or reviewed, off-field, with another official
   using instant replays to make decisions. In some sports, players can
   now challenge decisions made by officials. In Association football,
   goal-line technology makes decisions on whether a ball has crossed the
   goal line or not.^[44] The technology is not compulsory,^[45] but was
   used in the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil,^[46] and the 2015 FIFA
   Women's World Cup in Canada,^[47] as well as in the Premier League from
   2013–14,^[48] and the Bundesliga from 2015–16.^[49] In the NFL, a
   referee can ask for a review from the replay booth, or a head coach can
   issue a challenge to review the play using replays. The final decision
   rests with the referee.^[50] A video referee (commonly known as a
   Television Match Official or TMO) can also use replays to help
   decision-making in rugby (both league and union).^[51]^[52] In
   international cricket, an umpire can ask the Third umpire for a
   decision, and the third umpire makes the final decision.^[53]^[54]
   Since 2008, a decision review system for players to review decisions
   has been introduced and used in ICC-run tournaments, and optionally in
   other matches.^[53]^[55] Depending on the host broadcaster, a number of
   different technologies are used during an umpire or player review,
   including instant replays, Hawk-Eye, Hot Spot and Real Time
   Snickometer.^[56]^[57] Hawk-Eye is also used in tennis to challenge
   umpiring decisions.^[58]^[59]

Sports and education

   Research suggests that sports have the capacity to connect youth to
   positive adult role models and provide positive development
   opportunities, as well as promote the learning and application of life
   skills.^[60]^[61] In recent years the use of sport to reduce crime, as
   well as to prevent violent extremism and radicalization, has become
   more widespread, especially as a tool to improve self-esteem, enhance
   social bonds and provide participants with a feeling of purpose.^[61]

   There is no high-quality evidence that shows the effectiveness of
   interventions to increase sports participation of the community in
   sports such as mass media campaigns, educational sessions, and policy
   changes.^[62] There is also no high-quality studies that investigate
   the effect of such interventions in promoting healthy behaviour change
   in the community.^[63]

Politics

   Main article: Politics and sports

   Benito Mussolini used the 1934 FIFA World Cup, which was held in Italy,
   to showcase Fascist Italy.^[64]^[65] Adolf Hitler also used the 1936
   Summer Olympics held in Berlin, and the 1936 Winter Olympics held in
   Garmisch-Partenkirchen, to promote the Nazi ideology of the superiority
   of the Aryan race, and inferiority of the Jews and other
   "undesirables".^[65]^[66] Germany used the Olympics to give off a
   peaceful image while secretly preparing for war.^[67]

   When apartheid was the official policy in South Africa, many sports
   people, particularly in rugby union, adopted the conscientious approach
   that they should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this
   was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy
   of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its
   worst effects.^[68]

   In the history of Ireland, Gaelic sports were connected with cultural
   nationalism. Until the mid-20th century a person could have been banned
   from playing Gaelic football, hurling, or other sports administered by
   the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) if she/he played or supported
   Association football, or other GAME seen to be of British origin.
   Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of football and
   rugby union at Gaelic venues. This ban, also known as Rule 42,^[69] is
   still enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be
   played in Croke Park while Lansdowne Road was redeveloped into Aviva
   Stadium. Until recently, under Rule 21, the GAA also banned members of
   the British security forces and members of the RUC from playing Gaelic
   GAME, but the advent of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 led to the
   eventual removal of the ban.^[70]

   Nationalism is often evident in the pursuit of sport, or in its
   reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and
   audiences can adopt a partisan view. On occasion, such tensions can
   lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and
   beyond the sporting venue, as in the Football War. These trends are
   seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being
   carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.

   Sport and politics collided in the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Masked men
   entered the hotel of the Israeli Olympic team and killed many of their
   men. This was known as the Munich massacre.

   A study of US elections has shown that the result of sports events can
   affect the results. A study published in the Proceedings of the
   National Academy of Sciences showed that when the home team wins the
   GAME before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their
   share of the vote by 1.5 per cent. A loss had the opposite effect, and
   the effect is greater for higher-profile teams or unexpected wins and
   losses.^[71] Also, when Washington Redskins win their final GAME before
   an election, then the incumbent president is more likely to win, and if
   the Redskins lose, then the opposition candidate is more likely to win;
   this has become known as the Redskins Rule.^[72]^[73]

  As a means of controlling and subduing populations

   Étienne de La Boétie, in his essay Discourse on Voluntary Servitude
   describes athletic spectacles as means for tyrants to control their
   subjects by distracting them.

     Do not imagine that there is any bird more easily caught by decoy,
     nor any fish sooner fixed on the hook by wormy bait, than are all
     these poor fools neatly tricked into servitude by the slightest
     feather passed, so to speak, before their mouths. Truly it is a
     marvellous thing that they let themselves be caught so quickly at
     the slightest tickling of their fancy. Plays, farces, spectacles,
     gladiators, strange beasts, medals, pictures, and other such
     opiates, these were for ancient peoples the bait toward slavery, the
     price of their liberty, the instruments of tyranny. By these
     practices and enticements the ancient dictators so successfully
     lulled their subjects under the yoke, that the stupefied peoples,
     fascinated by the pastimes and vain pleasures flashed before their
     eyes, learned subservience as naïvely, but not so creditably, as
     little children learn to read by looking at bright picture
     books.^[74]

   During the British rule of Bengal, British and European sports began to
   supplant traditional Bengali sports, resulting in a loss of native
   culture.^[75]^[76]

Religious views

   Main article: New Testament athletic metaphors

   [220px-Panathenaic_amphora_Kleophrades_Louvre_F277.jpg] The foot race
   was one of the events dedicated to Zeus. Panathenaic amphora,
   Kleophrades painter, c. 500 BC, Louvre museum.

   Sport was an important form of worship in Ancient Greek religion. The
   ancient Olympic GAME were held in honour of the head deity, Zeus, and
   featured various forms of religious dedication to him and other
   gods.^[77] As many Greeks travelled to see the GAME, this combination
   of religion and sport also served as a way of uniting them.

   The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some
   Christian thinkers as a form of idolatry, in which "human beings extol
   themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward
   themselves."^[78] Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation
   of "collective pride" and "national self-deification" in which feats of
   human power are idolised at the expense of divine worship.^[78]

   Tertullian condemns the athletic performances of his day, insisting
   "the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon idolatry."^[79] The
   shows, says Tertullian, excite passions foreign to the calm temperament
   cultivated by the Christian:

     God has enjoined us to deal calmly, gently, quietly, and peacefully
     with the Holy Spirit, because these things are alone in keeping with
     the goodness of His nature, with His tenderness and sensitiveness.
     ... Well, how shall this be made to accord with the shows? For the
     show always leads to spiritual agitation, since where there is
     pleasure, there is keenness of feeling giving pleasure its zest; and
     where there is keenness of feeling, there is rivalry giving in turn
     its zest to that. Then, too, where you have rivalry, you have rage,
     bitterness, wrath and grief, with all bad things which flow from
     them – the whole entirely out of keeping with the religion of
     Christ.^[80]

   Christian clerics in the Wesleyan-Holiness movement oppose the viewing
   of or participation in professional sports, believing that professional
   sports leagues profane the Sabbath as in the modern era, certain
   associations hold GAME on the Lord's Day.^[81] They also criticise
   professional sports for its fostering of a commitment that competes
   with a Christian's primary commitment to God in opposition to 1
   Corinthians 7:35, what they perceive to be a lack of modesty in the
   players' and cheerleaders' uniforms (which are not in conformity with
   the Methodistic doctrine of outward holiness), its association with
   violence in opposition to Hebrews 7:26, what they perceive to be the
   extensive use of profanity among many players that contravenes
   Colossians 3:8–10, and the frequent presence of gambling, as well as
   alcohol and other drugs at sporting events, which go against a
   commitment to teetotalism.^[81]

23. Never Have I Ever

   A classic GAME often played at camp, teams can also play Never Have I
   Ever at the office. To start, players hold up five fingers. Then, in a
   circle, players name something that they have never done before. For
   example, “Never have I ever baked banana bread.” Any team member who
   has had the named experience puts a finger down. The last person still
   holding up fingers by the end of the GAME is the winner. Through Never
   I Have Ever, players learn many interesting and surprising things about
   their coworkers.

   Here is a prompt generator to use for your GAME:

   (neverhaveiever) ✨ Generate Prompt ✨

24. Silent Interview

   Silent Interview is a unique team building GAME where teams conduct a
   job interview without using any words. To start, pair up two
   participants and have one ask the other interview questions. The
   interviewee must answer questions using only gestures, expressions, and
   nonverbal communication. Meanwhile, the team tries to guess the
   “candidate’s” qualifications based on these silent interactions. At the
   end of the interview, the team will decide if they would hire this
   candidate or not. This GAME is a fun and challenging way to improve
   communication skills and teamwork in a nontraditional setting.

25. Number of Things in Common

   Number of Things in Common is a twist on the GAME “Something in
   Common.” In the original GAME, teammates are looking for traits they
   all share. In this version of the GAME, players go one step further and
   look for qualities that a certain number of them have in common.

   For instance, if your group has four members, then you must find the
   following:
     * Something all four have in common
     * Something three out of four have in common
     * Something two out of four have in common
     * Something that none of you have in common (for example, no one has
       the same favorite food)

   Then, share your best finds with the rest of the group.

   This version of the GAME requires slightly more discussion and strategy
   than Something in Common.

26. Popular Opinions

   Popular Opinions is a GAME that encourages teammates to guess how the
   majority of their coworkers will answer. The GAME is simple. A leader
   gives a question, and players must answer not with their own personal
   preferences but with the answer they believe will be the most popular
   among their peers.

   For example, if the question is “What is your favorite drink to order
   at happy hour?” and you know that your group frequents the Mexican
   cantina down the street, then you might answer “margarita.”

   You can play in teams and come to a group consensus.

27. ABC Hunt

   ABC Hunt is an amusing indoor team building GAME that gets your virtual
   team out of their seats. In this GAME, a host names three random
   letters of the alphabet, and the other team members scramble to find
   objects beginning with each letter. The person who finds three objects
   the fastest wins. ABC Hunt is also a versatile DIY team building GAME
   since teams can play it remotely and at the office.

   Here is a list with more fun word GAME to play.

28. Pitch Me Your Business

   If you want to spark your team’s entrepreneurial spirit, then Pitch Me
   Your Business is a wonderful GAME to try. For this GAME, team members
   have 15 minutes to come up with a basic business plan for an
   enterprise. Then, team members will present the business idea to a
   designated “investor.” The person who dreams up the most intriguing
   business wins. Pitch Me Your Business is a smart team building GAME
   without materials because managers can informally evaluate team
   leadership and entrepreneurial skills through this GAME.

   Here are more competitive team building GAME to try.

29. Line GAME

   The Line GAME brings teams together by showing colleagues unexpected
   commonalities. Before initiating the GAME, create a list of experiences
   that underscore the commonalities your team members may have, ordering
   the list from lighthearted to more serious. Then, gather your team and
   have team members keep track of every experience. At the end of the
   GAME, collect your team’s responses and display the results, showing
   your team how much they have in common.

30. Ambassadors

   Ambassadors is a lively GAME where team members act as ambassadors for
   foreign countries. After assigning countries to players using a random
   country generator, each ambassador must describe the assigned country
   without revealing the country’s name. The winner is the player who
   guesses the most countries correctly. Ambassadors is a great GAME for
   team building because it is educational and requires your team to
   exercise creative and communication skills.

31. Work Limericks

   Limericks are a whimsical form of poetry with a distinct rhythm. In
   Work Limericks, teams use creative muscles to write limericks based on
   work experiences. After familiarizing your team with guidelines on how
   to write limericks, give everyone a period of time to compose
   limericks. Then, have your team vote on which limericks are their
   favorites. The limerick with the most votes wins. Work Limericks is an
   excellent GAME because it lets your team exercise creativity and share
   creations with others.

32. Hangman

   A GAME you’ve probably played as a child, Hangman, can also be
   effective for team building. Not only is your team already familiar
   with the rules, but Hangman also expands your team’s vocabulary and
   establishes shared references that can be great future conversation
   starters. Also, Hangman is exceptional for team building because it
   unites the team by pushing your coworkers to work together to
   successfully guess the word.

33. Alphabet Chain

   Alphabet Chain is a terrific GAME for teams who wish to increase
   vocabularies. In this GAME, your team first settles on a topic. Then,
   team members must name words that fit in that topic. However, every
   word proposed needs to begin with the last letter of the previous one.
   If a team member is unable to think of a suitable word and breaks the
   chain, then that person must withdraw. The winner of the GAME is the
   last person still remaining. Since Alphabet Chain only requires an
   expansive vocabulary to play, no materials are needed, making it an
   easy GAME to start with.

34. Dance Off

   Dance Off is a fun GAME that lets your team express themselves through
   dance. As the name suggests, the objective of Dance Off is for your
   team to compete and see who the best dancer is. Create a playlist of
   danceable tunes and clear a space for your team to move freely. Then,
   have your team make a circle and begin playing music. Each team member
   gets a few minutes to show off moves in the center of the circle.
   Everyone votes for the most impressive dancer, and whoever gets the
   most votes wins. Dance Off lets your team cut loose and stay active,
   which is great for stress relief.

35. The Human Knot

   The Human Knot is one of the most popular free team building GAME. To
   play, teammates stand in a circle and grab the hands of coworkers
   across the way. Then, participants must detangle their arms without
   breaking their grip. This GAME improves problem-solving and
   communication skills among groups. The exercise requires no supplies or
   costs. Best of all, you can do the challenge repeatedly because the
   knot will be different each time, and new team members may have
   different approaches.

   Learn how to do The Human Knot.

36. Two Truths and One Lie

   Two Truths and One Lie is another fun way to learn more about your
   colleagues. Best of all, this GAME requires no materials! In this GAME,
   a team member presents two true statements and one lie. The other
   members have to guess which statement is the lie. If any of the team
   members guess correctly, then that person earns a point. However, if no
   one guesses correctly, then the person who presented the statements
   wins a point. The winner is the person with the most points by the end
   of the GAME.

   Structured form of play
   For other uses, see GAME (disambiguation).

   [220px-Gaming_Board_Inscribed_for_Amenhotep_III_with_Separate_Sliding_D
   rawer%2C_ca._1390-1353_B.C.E.%2C49.56a-b.jpg] Ancient Egyptian senet
   GAME board inscribed for Amenhotep III with separate sliding drawer,
   from 1390 to 1353 BC, made of glazed faience, dimensions: 5.5 × 7.7 ×
   21 cm, in the Brooklyn Museum (New York City)

   A GAME is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for
   entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool.^[1]
   Many GAME are also considered to be work (such as professional players
   of spectator sports or GAME) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or GAME
   involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video
   GAME).

   GAME are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for
   achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or
   online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an
   audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by
   watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a GAME may
   constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often,
   part of the entertainment for children playing a GAME is deciding who
   is part of their audience and who is a player. A toy and a GAME are not
   the same. Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas GAME
   present rules for the player to follow.

   Key components of GAME are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction.
   GAME generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both.
   Many GAME help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise,
   or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological
   role.

   Attested as early as 2600 BC,^[2]^[3] GAME are a universal part of
   human experience and present in all cultures. The Royal GAME of Ur,
   Senet, and Mancala are some of the oldest known GAME.^[4]

Definitions

   Look up GAME in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.

Ludwig Wittgenstein

   Ludwig Wittgenstein was probably the first academic philosopher to
   address the definition of the word GAME. In his Philosophical
   Investigations,^[5] Wittgenstein argued that the elements of GAME,
   such as play, rules, and competition, all fail to adequately define
   what GAME are. From this, Wittgenstein concluded that people apply the
   term GAME to a range of disparate human activities that bear to one
   another only what one might call family resemblances. As the following
   GAME definitions show, this conclusion was not a final one and today
   many philosophers, like Thomas Hurka, think that Wittgenstein was wrong
   and that Bernard Suits' definition is a good answer to the problem.^[6]

Roger Caillois

   French sociologist Roger Caillois, in his book Les JEU et les hommes
   (GAME and Men)(1961),^[7] defined a GAME as an activity that must have
   the following characteristics:
     * fun: the activity is chosen for its light-hearted character
     * separate: it is circumscribed in time and place
     * uncertain: the outcome of the activity is unforeseeable
     * non-productive: participation does not accomplish anything useful
     * governed by rules: the activity has rules that are different from
       everyday life
     * fictitious: it is accompanied by the awareness of a different
       reality

Chris Crawford

   GAME designer Chris Crawford defined the term in the context of
   computers.^[8] Using a series of dichotomies:
    1. Creative expression is art if made for its own beauty, and
       entertainment if made for money.
    2. A piece of entertainment is a plaything if it is interactive.
       Movies and books are cited as examples of non-interactive
       entertainment.
    3. If no goals are associated with a plaything, it is a toy. (Crawford
       notes that by his definition, (a) a toy can become a GAME element
       if the player makes up rules, and (b) The Sims and SimCity are
       toys, not GAME.) If it has goals, a plaything is a challenge.
    4. If a challenge has no "active agent against whom you compete", it
       is a puzzle; if there is one, it is a conflict. (Crawford admits
       that this is a subjective test. Video GAME with noticeably
       algorithmic artificial intelligence can be played as puzzles; these
       include the patterns used to evade ghosts in Pac-Man.)
    5. Finally, if the player can only outperform the opponent, but not
       attack them to interfere with their performance, the conflict is a
       competition. (Competitions include racing and figure skating.)
       However, if attacks are allowed, then the conflict qualifies as a
       GAME.

   Crawford's definition may thus be rendered as: an interactive,
   goal-oriented activity made for money, with active agents to play
   against, in which players (including active agents) can interfere with
   each other.

   Other definitions, however, as well as history, show that entertainment
   and GAME are not necessarily undertaken for monetary gain.

Other definitions

     * "Voluntary effort to overcome unnecessary obstacles." Bernard
       Suits^[9]
     * "A GAME is a form of art in which participants, termed players,
       make decisions in order to manage resources through GAME tokens in
       the pursuit of a goal." (Greg Costikyan)^[10] According to this
       definition, some "GAME" that do not involve choices, such as
       Chutes and Ladders, Candy Land, and War are not technically GAME
       any more than a slot machine is.
     * "A GAME is a form of play with goals and structure." (Kevin J.
       Maroney)^[11]
     * "A GAME is a system in which players engage in an artificial
       conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable
       outcome." (Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman)^[12]
     * "A GAME is an activity among two or more independent
       decision-makers seeking to achieve their objectives in some
       limiting context." (Clark C. Abt)^[13]
     * "At its most elementary level then we can define GAME as an
       exercise of voluntary control systems in which there is an
       opposition between forces, confined by a procedure and rules in
       order to produce a disequilibrial outcome." (Elliot Avedon and
       Brian Sutton-Smith)^[14]
     * "To play a GAME is to engage in activity directed toward bringing
       about a specific state of affairs, using only means permitted by
       specific rules, where the means permitted by the rules are more
       limited in scope than they would be in the absence of the rules,
       and where the sole reason for accepting such limitation is to make
       possible such activity." (Bernard Suits)^[15]
     * "When you strip away the genre differences and the technological
       complexities, all GAME share four defining traits: a goal, rules,
       a feedback system, and voluntary participation." (Jane
       McGonigal)^[16]

Gameplay elements and classification

   GAME can be characterized by "what the player does".^[8] This is often
   referred to as gameplay. Major key elements identified in this context
   are tools and rules that define the overall context of GAME.

Tools

   [220px-Game_pieces.jpg] A selection of pieces from different GAME.
   From top: Chess pawns, marbles, Monopoly tokens, dominoes, Monopoly
   hotels, jacks and checkers pieces.

   GAME are often classified by the components required to play them
   (e.g. miniatures, a ball, cards, a board and pieces, or a computer). In
   places where the use of leather is well-established, the ball has been
   a popular GAME piece throughout recorded history, resulting in a
   worldwide popularity of ball GAME such as rugby, basketball, soccer
   (football), cricket, tennis, and volleyball. Other tools are more
   idiosyncratic to a certain region. Many countries in Europe, for
   instance, have unique standard decks of playing cards. Other GAME such
   as chess may be traced primarily through the development and evolution
   of its GAME pieces.

   Many GAME tools are tokens, meant to represent other things. A token
   may be a pawn on a board, play money, or an intangible item such as a
   point scored.

   GAME such as hide-and-seek or tag do not use any obvious tool; rather,
   their interactivity is defined by the environment. GAME with the same
   or similar rules may have different gameplay if the environment is
   altered. For example, hide-and-seek in a school building differs from
   the same GAME in a park; an auto race can be radically different
   depending on the track or street course, even with the same cars.

Rules and aims

   GAME are often characterized by their tools and rules. While rules are
   subject to variations and changes, enough change in the rules usually
   results in a "new" GAME. For instance, baseball can be played with
   "real" baseballs or with wiffleballs. However, if the players decide to
   play with only three bases, they are arguably playing a different GAME.
   There are exceptions to this in that some GAME deliberately involve
   the changing of their own rules, but even then there are often
   immutable meta-rules.

   Rules generally determine the time-keeping system, the rights and
   responsibilities of the players, scoring techniques, preset boundaries,
   and each player's goals.

   The rules of a GAME may be distinguished from its aims.^[17]^[18] For
   most competitive GAME, the ultimate aim is winning: in this sense,
   checkmate is the aim of chess.^[19] Common win conditions are being
   first to amass a certain quota of points or tokens (as in Settlers of
   Catan), having the greatest number of tokens at the end of the GAME (as
   in Monopoly), or some relationship of one's GAME tokens to those of
   one's opponent (as in chess's checkmate). There may also be
   intermediate aims, which are tasks that move a player toward winning.
   For instance, an intermediate aim in football is to score goals,
   because scoring goals will increase one's likelihood of winning the
   GAME, but is not alone sufficient to win the GAME.

   An aim identifies a sufficient condition for successful action, whereas
   the rule identifies a necessary condition for permissible action.^[18]
   For example, the aim of chess is to checkmate, but although it is
   expected that players will try to checkmate each other, it is not a
   rule of chess that a player must checkmate the other player whenever
   possible. Similarly, it is not a rule of football that a player must
   score a goal on a penalty; while it is expected the player will try, it
   is not required. While meeting the aims often requires a certain degree
   of skill and (in some cases) luck, following the rules of a GAME merely
   requires knowledge of the rules and some careful attempt to follow
   them; it rarely (if ever) requires luck or demanding skills.

Skill, strategy, and chance

   A GAME's tools and rules will result in its requiring skill, strategy,
   luck, or a combination thereof, and are classified accordingly.

   GAME of skill include GAME of physical skill, such as wrestling, tug
   of war, hopscotch, target shooting, and stake, and GAME of mental
   skill such as checkers and chess. GAME of strategy include checkers,
   chess, Go, arimaa, and tic-tac-toe, and often require special equipment
   to play them. GAME of chance include gambling GAME (blackjack,
   Mahjong, roulette, etc.), as well as snakes and ladders and rock,
   paper, scissors; most require equipment such as cards or dice. However,
   most GAME contain two or all three of these elements. For example,
   American football and baseball involve both physical skill and strategy
   while tiddlywinks, poker, and Monopoly combine strategy and chance.
   Many card and board GAME combine all three; most trick-taking GAME
   involve mental skill, strategy, and an element of chance, as do many
   strategic board GAME such as Risk, Settlers of Catan, and Carcassonne.

Single-player GAME

   "Single-player GAME" redirects here. For single-player video GAME, see
   Single-player video GAME.

   Most GAME require multiple players. However, single-player GAME are
   unique in respect to the type of challenges a player faces. Unlike a
   GAME with multiple players competing with or against each other to
   reach the GAME's goal, a one-player GAME is a battle solely against an
   element of the environment (an artificial opponent), against one's own
   skills, against time, or against chance. Playing with a yo-yo or
   playing tennis against a wall is not generally recognized as playing a
   GAME due to the lack of any formidable opposition. Many GAME described
   as "single-player" may be termed actually puzzles or recreations.

   Lucas van Leyden (1520) depicting a multiplayer card GAME

   A multiplayer GAME is a GAME of several players who may be independent
   opponents or teams. GAME with many independent players are difficult
   to analyze formally using GAME theory as the players may form and
   switch coalitions.^[20] The term "GAME" in this context may mean either
   a true GAME played for entertainment or a competitive activity
   describable in principle by mathematical GAME theory.

GAME theory

   Main article: GAME theory

   John Nash proved that GAME with several players have a stable solution
   provided that coalitions between players are disallowed. Nash won the
   Nobel prize for economics for this important result which extended von
   Neumann's theory of zero-sum GAME. Nash's stable solution is known as
   the Nash equilibrium.^[21]

   If cooperation between players is allowed, then the GAME becomes more
   complex; many concepts have been developed to analyze such GAME. While
   these have had some partial success in the fields of economics,
   politics and conflict, no good general theory has yet been
   developed.^[21]

   In quantum GAME theory, it has been found that the introduction of
   quantum information into multiplayer GAME allows a new type of
   equilibrium strategy not found in traditional GAME. The entanglement
   of player's choices can have the effect of a contract by preventing
   players from profiting from what is known as betrayal.^[22]

   [220px-Tug-of-war.jpg] Tug of war is an easily organized, impromptu
   GAME that requires little equipment.

   GAME can take a variety of forms, from competitive sports to board
   GAME and video GAME.

Sports

   Main article: Sport
   Association football is a popular sport worldwide.

   Many sports require special equipment and dedicated playing fields,
   leading to the involvement of a community much larger than the group of
   players. A city or town may set aside such resources for the
   organization of sports leagues.

   Popular sports may have spectators who are entertained just by watching
   GAME. A community will often align itself with a local sports team
   that supposedly represents it (even if the team or most of its players
   only recently moved in); they often align themselves against their
   opponents or have traditional rivalries. The concept of fandom began
   with sports fans.

Lawn GAME

   Lawn GAME are outdoor GAME that can be played on a lawn; an area of
   mowed grass (or alternately, on graded soil) generally smaller than a
   sports field (pitch). Variations of many GAME that are traditionally
   played on a sports field are marketed as "lawn GAME" for home use in a
   front or back yard. Common lawn GAME include horseshoes, sholf,
   croquet, bocce, and lawn bowls.

Tabletop GAME

   Main article: Tabletop GAME

   A tabletop GAME is a GAME where the elements of play are confined to a
   small area and require little physical exertion, usually simply
   placing, picking up and moving GAME pieces. Most of these GAME are
   played at a table around which the players are seated and on which the
   GAME's elements are located. However, many GAME falling into this
   category, particularly party GAME, are more free-form in their play
   and can involve physical activity such as mime. Still, these GAME do
   not require a large area in which to play them, large amounts of
   strength or stamina, or specialized equipment other than what comes in
   a box.

    Dexterity and coordination GAME

   This class of GAME includes any GAME in which the skill element
   involved relates to manual dexterity or hand-eye coordination, but
   excludes the class of video GAME (see below). GAME such as jacks,
   paper football, and Jenga require only very portable or improvised
   equipment and can be played on any flat level surface, while other
   examples, such as pinball, billiards, air hockey, foosball, and table
   hockey require specialized tables or other self-contained modules on
   which the GAME is played. The advent of home video GAME systems largely
   replaced some of these, such as table hockey, however air hockey,
   billiards, pinball and foosball remain popular fixtures in private and
   public GAME rooms. These GAME and others, as they require reflexes and
   coordination, are generally performed more poorly by intoxicated
   persons but are unlikely to result in injury because of this; as such
   the GAME are popular as drinking GAME. In addition, dedicated
   drinking GAME such as quarters and beer pong also involve physical
   coordination and are popular for similar reasons.

    Board GAME

   Main article: Board GAME

   [220px-Clann.jpg] Parcheesi is an American adaptation of a Pachisi,
   originating in India.

   Board GAME use as a central tool a board on which the players' status,
   resources, and progress are tracked using physical tokens. Many also
   involve dice or cards. Most GAME that simulate war are board GAME
   (though a large number of video GAME have been created to simulate
   strategic combat), and the board may be a map on which the players'
   tokens move. Virtually all board GAME involve "turn-based" play; one
   player contemplates and then makes a move, then the next player does
   the same, and a player can only act on their turn. This is opposed to
   "real-time" play as is found in some card GAME, most sports and most
   video GAME.

   Some GAME, such as chess and Go, are entirely deterministic, relying
   only on the strategy element for their interest. Such GAME are usually
   described as having "perfect information"; the only unknown is the
   exact thought processes of one's opponent, not the outcome of any
   unknown event inherent in the GAME (such as a card draw or die roll).
   Children's GAME, on the other hand, tend to be very luck-based, with
   GAME such as Candy Land and Chutes and Ladders having virtually no
   decisions to be made. By some definitions, such as that by Greg
   Costikyan, they are not GAME since there are no decisions to make
   which affect the outcome.^[10] Many other GAME involving a high degree
   of luck do not allow direct attacks between opponents; the random event
   simply determines a gain or loss in the standing of the current player
   within the GAME, which is independent of any other player; the "GAME"
   then is actually a "race" by definitions such as Crawford's.

   Most other board GAME combine strategy and luck factors; the GAME of
   backgammon requires players to decide the best strategic move based on
   the roll of two dice. Trivia GAME have a great deal of randomness
   based on the questions a person gets. German-style board GAME are
   notable for often having rather less of a luck factor than many board
   GAME.

   Board GAME groups include race GAME, roll-and-move GAME, abstract
   strategy GAME, word GAME, and warGAME, as well as trivia and other
   elements. Some board GAME fall into multiple groups or incorporate
   elements of other genres: Cranium is one popular example, where players
   must succeed in each of four skills: artistry, live performance,
   trivia, and language.

    Card GAME

   Main article: Card GAME

   Further information: Collectible card GAME

   [220px-Kaartspelers%2C_Theodoor_Rombouts%2C_17de_eeuw%2C_Koninklijk_Mus
   eum_voor_Schone_Kunsten_Antwerpen%2C_358.jpg] Playing Cards, by
   Theodoor Rombouts, 17th century

   Card GAME use a deck of cards as their central tool. These cards may
   be a standard Anglo-American (52-card) deck of playing cards (such as
   for bridge, poker, Rummy, etc.), a regional deck using 32, 36 or
   40 cards and different suit signs (such as for the popular German GAME
   skat), a tarot deck of 78 cards (used in Europe to play a variety of
   trick-taking GAME collectively known as Tarot, Tarock or Tarocchi
   GAME), or a deck specific to the individual GAME (such as Set or 1000
   Blank White Cards). Uno and Rook are examples of GAME that were
   originally played with a standard deck and have since been
   commercialized with customized decks. Some collectible card GAME such
   as Magic: The Gathering are played with a small selection of cards that
   have been collected or purchased individually from large available
   sets.

   Some board GAME include a deck of cards as a gameplay element,
   normally for randomization or to keep track of GAME progress.
   Conversely, some card GAME such as Cribbage use a board with movers,
   normally to keep score. The differentiation between the two genres in
   such cases depends on which element of the GAME is foremost in its
   play; a board GAME using cards for random actions can usually use some
   other method of randomization, while Cribbage can just as easily be
   scored on paper. These elements as used are simply the traditional and
   easiest methods to achieve their purpose.

    Dice GAME

   Main article: Dice GAME

   [220px-Math_GAME_-_Big_Brother_Mouse_activity_day.jpg] Students using
   dice to improve numeracy skills. They roll three dice, then use basic
   math operations to combine those into a new number which they cover on
   the board. The goal is to cover four squares in the row.

   Dice GAME use a number of dice as their central element. Board GAME
   often use dice for a randomization element, and thus each roll of the
   dice has a profound impact on the outcome of the GAME, however dice
   GAME are differentiated in that the dice do not determine the success
   or failure of some other element of the GAME; they instead are the
   central indicator of the person's standing in the GAME. Popular dice
   GAME include Yahtzee, Farkle, Bunco, Liar's dice/Perudo, and Poker
   dice. As dice are, by their very nature, designed to produce apparently
   random numbers, these GAME usually involve a high degree of luck,
   which can be directed to some extent by the player through more
   strategic elements of play and through tenets of probability theory.
   Such GAME are thus popular as gambling GAME; the GAME of Craps is
   perhaps the most famous example, though Liar's dice and Poker dice were
   originally conceived of as gambling GAME.

    Domino and tile GAME

   Main articles: Tile-based GAME and Dominoes

   Domino GAME are similar in many respects to card GAME, but the
   generic device is instead a set of tiles called dominoes, which
   traditionally each have two ends, each with a given number of dots, or
   "pips", and each combination of two possible end values as it appears
   on a tile is unique in the set. The GAME played with dominoes largely
   center around playing a domino from the player's "hand" onto the
   matching end of another domino, and the overall object could be to
   always be able to make a play, to make all open endpoints sum to a
   given number or multiple, or simply to play all dominoes from one's
   hand onto the board. Sets vary in the number of possible dots on one
   end, and thus of the number of combinations and pieces; the most common
   set historically is double-six, though in more recent times "extended"
   sets such as double-nine have been introduced to increase the number of
   dominoes available, which allows larger hands and more players in a
   GAME. Muggins, Mexican Train, and Chicken Foot are very popular domino
   GAME. Texas 42 is a domino GAME more similar in its play to a
   "trick-taking" card GAME.

   Variations of traditional dominoes abound: Triominoes are similar in
   theory but are triangular and thus have three values per tile.
   Similarly, a GAME known as Quad-Ominos uses four-sided tiles.

   Some other GAME use tiles in place of cards; Rummikub is a variant of
   the Rummy card GAME family that uses tiles numbered in ascending rank
   among four colors, very similar in makeup to a 2-deck "pack" of
   Anglo-American playing cards. Mahjong is another GAME very similar to
   Rummy that uses a set of tiles with card-like values and art.

   Lastly, some GAME use graphical tiles to form a board layout, on which
   other elements of the GAME are played. Settlers of Catan and
   Carcassonne are examples. In each, the "board" is made up of a series
   of tiles; in Settlers of Catan the starting layout is random but
   static, while in Carcassonne the GAME is played by "building" the board
   tile-by-tile. Hive, an abstract strategy GAME using tiles as moving
   pieces, has mechanical and strategic elements similar to chess,
   although it has no board; the pieces themselves both form the layout
   and can move within it.

    Pencil and paper GAME

   Main article: Paper-and-pencil GAME

   Pencil and paper GAME require little or no specialized equipment other
   than writing materials, though some such GAME have been commercialized
   as board GAME (Scrabble, for instance, is based on the idea of a
   crossword puzzle, and tic-tac-toe sets with a boxed grid and pieces are
   available commercially). These GAME vary widely, from GAME centering
   on a design being drawn such as Pictionary and "connect-the-dots" GAME
   like sprouts, to letter and word GAME such as Boggle and
   Scattergories, to solitaire and logic puzzle GAME such as Sudoku and
   crossword puzzles.

    Guessing GAME

   Main article: Guessing GAME

   A guessing GAME has as its core a piece of information that one player
   knows, and the object is to coerce others into guessing that piece of
   information without actually divulging it in text or spoken word.
   Charades is probably the most well-known GAME of this type, and has
   spawned numerous commercial variants that involve differing rules on
   the type of communication to be given, such as Catch Phrase, Taboo,
   Pictionary, and similar. The genre also includes many GAME shows such
   as Win, Lose or Draw, Password and $25,000 Pyramid.

  Video GAME

   Main article: Video GAME

   See also: Electronic GAME

   Video GAME are computer- or microprocessor-controlled GAME. Computers
   can create virtual spaces for a wide variety of GAME types. Some video
   GAME simulate conventional GAME objects like cards or dice, while
   others can simulate environs either grounded in reality or fantastical
   in design, each with its own set of rules or goals.

   A computer or video GAME uses one or more input devices, typically a
   button/joystick combination (on arcade GAME); a keyboard, mouse or
   trackball (computer GAME); or a controller or a motion sensitive tool
   (console GAME). More esoteric devices such as paddle controllers have
   also been used for input.

   There are many genres of video GAME; the first commercial video GAME,
   Pong, was a simple simulation of table tennis. As processing power
   increased, new genres such as adventure and action GAME were developed
   that involved a player guiding a character from a third person
   perspective through a series of obstacles. This "real-time" element
   cannot be easily reproduced by a board GAME, which is generally limited
   to "turn-based" strategy; this advantage allows video GAME to simulate
   situations such as combat more realistically. Additionally, the playing
   of a video GAME does not require the same physical skill, strength or
   danger as a real-world representation of the GAME, and can provide
   either very realistic, exaggerated or impossible physics, allowing for
   elements of a fantastical nature, GAME involving physical violence, or
   simulations of sports. Lastly, a computer can, with varying degrees of
   success, simulate one or more human opponents in traditional table
   GAME such as chess, leading to simulations of such GAME that can be
   played by a single player.

   In more open-ended computer simulations, also known as sandbox-style
   GAME, the GAME provides a virtual environment in which the player may
   be free to do whatever they like within the confines of this universe.
   Sometimes, there is a lack of goals or opposition, which has stirred
   some debate on whether these should be considered "GAME" or "toys".
   (Crawford specifically mentions Will Wright's SimCity as an example of
   a toy.)^[8]

    Online GAME

   Main article: Online GAME

   Online GAME have been part of culture from the very earliest days of
   networked and time-shared computers. Early commercial systems such as
   Plato were at least as widely famous for their GAME as for their
   strictly educational value. In 1958, Tennis for Two dominated Visitor's
   Day and drew attention to the oscilloscope at the Brookhaven National
   Laboratory; during the 1980s, Xerox PARC was known mainly for Maze War,
   which was offered as a hands-on demo to visitors.

   Modern online GAME are played using an Internet connection; some have
   dedicated client programs, while others require only a web browser.
   Some simpler browser GAME appeal to more casual GAME-playing
   demographic groups (notably older audiences) that otherwise play very
   few video GAME.^[23]

  Role-playing GAME

   Main article: Role-playing GAME

   Role-playing GAME, often abbreviated as RPGs, are a type of GAME in
   which the participants (usually) assume the roles of characters acting
   in a fictional setting. The original role playing GAME – or at least
   those explicitly marketed as such – are played with a handful of
   participants, usually face-to-face, and keep track of the developing
   fiction with pen and paper. Together, the players may collaborate on a
   story involving those characters; create, develop, and "explore" the
   setting; or vicariously experience an adventure outside the bounds of
   everyday life. Pen-and-paper role-playing GAME include, for example,
   Dungeons &amp Dragons and GURPS.

   The term role-playing GAME has also been appropriated by the video GAME
   industry to describe a genre of video GAME. These may be single-player
   GAME where one player experiences a programmed environment and story,
   or they may allow players to interact through the internet. The
   experience is usually quite different from traditional role-playing
   GAME. Single-player GAME include Final Fantasy, Fable, The Elder
   Scrolls, and Mass Effect. Online multi-player GAME, often referred to
   as Massively Multiplayer Online role playing GAME, or MMORPGs, include
   RuneScape, EverQuest 2, Guild Wars, MapleStory, Anarchy Online, and
   Dofus. As of 2009^[update], the most successful MMORPG has been World
   of Warcraft, which controls the vast majority of the market.^[24]

  Business GAME

   Main article: Team building

   Business GAME can take a variety of forms, from interactive board
   GAME to interactive GAME involving different props (balls, ropes,
   hoops, etc.) and different kinds of activities. The purpose of these
   GAME is to link to some aspect of organizational performance and to
   generate discussions about business improvement. Many business GAME
   focus on organizational behaviors. Some of these are computer
   simulations while others are simple designs for play and debriefing.
   Team building is a common focus of such activities.

  Simulation

   Main article: Simulation GAME

   The term "GAME" can include simulation^[25]^[26] or re-enactment of
   various activities or use in "real life" for various purposes: e.g.,
   training, analysis, prediction. Well-known examples are war GAME and
   role-playing. The root of this meaning may originate in the human
   prehistory of GAME deduced by anthropology from observing primitive
   cultures, in which children's GAME mimic the activities of adults to a
   significant degree: hunting, warring, nursing, etc. These kinds of
   GAME are preserved in modern times.^[original research?]

   Research has shown that there are many benefits to playing GAME in the
   classroom. When planning lessons, teachers should try to incorporate at
   least one GAME a day into one of the key learning areas as either a
   teaching and learning tool, assessment strategy or classroom motivator.

     “Play is our brain’s favourite way of learning” – Diane Ackeman

   When playing GAME, students become more engaged in their learning,
   taught content is reinforced and class positivity is increased.

   In this blog we have outlined ten of the most important benefits
   students gain from playing GAME in the classroom. We have also
   selected some of our most popular Numeracy, Literacy, Technology,
   History and Fitness GAME for you to download and use in your own
   classroom.

10 Benefits to Playing GAME in the Classroom

More Motivation

   Playing GAME in the classroom increases overall motivation. By playing
   GAME, students become more motivated to learn, pay attention and
   participate in set tasks. GAME help students to become a part of a
   team as well as take responsibility for their own learning. They can
   also be a great classroom management tool, helping to motivate a class.

   They can also be a great classroom management tool, helping to motivate
   a class.

Controlled Competitiveness

   Students can become very competitive in the classroom, especially boys.
   GAME are a great way to control the competitiveness between peers.

   By using GAME in the classroom, students can compete against each
   other whilst playing a GAME, then support each other during other
   learning activities.

Strategy Simulator

   Most GAME require problem-solving strategies and planning. By applying
   a range of strategies in a GAME, students are able to use their working
   memory to solve problems, increasing their mental cognition.
   Stimulating the brain with strategies in a GAME can be a great brain
   workout!

Peer Positivity

   Using GAME in a lesson as part of teaching and learning helps to
   create positivity around the lesson, motivating students with their
   participation and creating a positive attitude towards learning.

   GAME can also create a positive memory and experience of learning for
   students in the classroom.

Smaller Stress

   Having to answer questions on a worksheet or produce a page of text can
   be quite daunting and stressful for some students. It can also create a
   negative perception of a students’ learning environment.

   As an alternative to worksheets, GAME can be used as a less stressful
   way for students to demonstrate their knowledge, skill and
   understanding of a topic. Being less stressed will help students to
   have a more positive perception of their learning environment and give
   a true indication of their own learning.

Mighty Memory

   Playing a range of content-specific GAME can increase memory! As they
   play a GAME, students need to remember important details about a topic
   but also use their working memory to think and act quickly.

   GAME that were made by the students can be some of the most effective.
   As students construct a GAME they are required to use their memory of
   specific content to create questions and answers suitable for the GAME,
   then use their memory of the topic to play the GAME.

Class Cooperation

   Playing GAME in the classroom increases class cooperation. Classroom
   GAME can also be used as a team-building exercise!

   Students need to work together as a team when playing as a whole class
   against the teacher, or in small team groups when playing GAME with
   each other.

   In this way, students learn how to take turns, build respect, listen to
   others and play fairly.

Alert Attention

   Playing GAME requires students to pay great attention to detail. As
   GAME can move quickly, when playing a GAME a student needs to be alert
   and attentive.

   This attentiveness when playing a GAME can help students to stay
   focused on other tasks in the classroom throughout the day.

Friendly Fun

   Playing GAME in the classroom is always great fun!

   When playing a GAME, endorphins are produced that stimulate the brain
   and gives students a feeling of euphoria. This feeling of euphoria
   creates a great sense of happiness and excitement for students in the
   classroom, developing a positive learning environment.

New Knowledge

   GAME are a great tool to use in the classroom to consolidate new
   knowledge.

   After teaching new content to the class, provide students with a GAME
   that will consolidate their understanding and make connections with
   what they already know. Asking students to create their own
   content-specific GAME can also be a great way to assess students at
   the end of a unit of work.

Take it Outside

   GAME aren’t just for inside the classroom. Going outside and enjoying
   the outdoors can also provide a bit of brain break for your students,
   all while consolidating a topic they are learning about!

   Here’s a great example… all you need are some hula hoops, bean bags and
   some enthusiastic kids!

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Complete plan on how a GAME player will behave in every possible GAME
   situation
   For other uses of "Strategy", see Strategy (disambiguation).

   In GAME theory, a player's strategy is any of the options which they
   choose in a setting where the optimal outcome depends not only on their
   own actions but on the actions of others.^[1] The discipline mainly
   concerns the action of a player in a GAME affecting the behavior or
   actions of other players. Some examples of "GAME" include chess,
   bridge, poker, monopoly, diplomacy or battleship.^[2] A player's
   strategy will determine the action which the player will take at any
   stage of the GAME. In studying GAME theory, economists enlist a more
   rational lens in analyzing decisions rather than the psychological or
   sociological perspectives taken when analyzing relationships between
   decisions of two or more parties in different disciplines.

   The strategy concept is sometimes (wrongly) confused with that of a
   move. A move is an action taken by a player at some point during the
   play of a GAME (e.g., in chess, moving white's Bishop a2 to b3). A
   strategy on the other hand is a complete algorithm for playing the
   GAME, telling a player what to do for every possible situation
   throughout the GAME. It is helpful to think about a "strategy" as a
   list of directions, and a "move" as a single turn on the list of
   directions itself. This strategy is based on the payoff or outcome of
   each action. The goal of each agent is to consider their payoff based
   on a competitors action. For example, competitor A can assume
   competitor B enters the market. From there, Competitor A compares the
   payoffs they receive by entering and not entering. The next step is to
   assume Competitor B doesn't enter and then consider which payoff is
   better based on if Competitor A chooses to enter or not enter. This
   technique can identify dominant strategies where a player can identify
   an action that they can take no matter what the competitor does to try
   to maximize the payoff. This also helps players to identify Nash
   equilibrium which are discussed in more detail below.

   A strategy profile (sometimes called a strategy combination) is a set
   of strategies for all players which fully specifies all actions in a
   GAME. A strategy profile must include one and only one strategy for
   every player.

Strategy set[edit]

   A player's strategy set defines what strategies are available for them
   to play. A strategy profile is a list of strategy sets, ordered from
   most to least desirable.

   A player has a finite strategy set if they have a number of discrete
   strategies available to them. For instance, a GAME of rock paper
   scissors comprises a single move by each player—and each player's move
   is made without knowledge of the other's, not as a response—so each
   player has the finite strategy set {rock paper scissors}.

   A strategy set is infinite otherwise. For instance the cake cutting
   GAME has a bounded continuum of strategies in the strategy set {Cut
   anywhere between zero percent and 100 percent of the cake}.

   In a dynamic GAME, GAME that are played over a series of time, the
   strategy set consists of the possible rules a player could give to a
   robot or agent on how to play the GAME. For instance, in the ultimatum
   GAME, the strategy set for the second player would consist of every
   possible rule for which offers to accept and which to reject.

   In a Bayesian GAME, or GAME in which players have incomplete
   information about one another, the strategy set is similar to that in a
   dynamic GAME. It consists of rules for what action to take for any
   possible private information.

Choosing a strategy set[edit]

   In applied GAME theory, the definition of the strategy sets is an
   important part of the art of making a GAME simultaneously solvable and
   meaningful. The GAME theorist can use knowledge of the overall problem,
   that is the friction between two or more players, to limit the strategy
   spaces, and ease the solution.

   For instance, strictly speaking in the Ultimatum GAME a player can have
   strategies such as: Reject offers of ($1, $3, $5, ..., $19), accept
   offers of ($0, $2, $4, ..., $20). Including all such strategies makes
   for a very large strategy space and a somewhat difficult problem. A
   GAME theorist might instead believe they can limit the strategy set to:
   {Reject any offer ≤ x, accept any offer >gt x; for x in ($0, $1, $2, ...,
   $20)}.

Pure and mixed strategies[edit]

   A pure strategy provides a complete definition of how a player will
   play a GAME. Pure strategy can be thought about as a singular concrete
   plan subject to the observations they make during the course of the
   GAME of play. In particular, it determines the move a player will make
   for any situation they could face. A player's strategy set is the set
   of pure strategies available to that player.

   A mixed strategy is an assignment of a probability to each pure
   strategy. When enlisting mixed strategy, it is often because the GAME
   doesn't allow for a rational description in specifying a pure strategy
   for the GAME. This allows for a player to randomly select a pure
   strategy. (See the following section for an illustration.) Since
   probabilities are continuous, there are infinitely many mixed
   strategies available to a player. Since probabilities are being
   assigned to strategies for a specific player when discussing the
   payoffs of certain scenarios the payoff must be referred to as
   "expected payoff".

   Of course, one can regard a pure strategy as a degenerate case of a
   mixed strategy, in which that particular pure strategy is selected with
   probability 1 and every other strategy with probability 0.

   A totally mixed strategy is a mixed strategy in which the player
   assigns a strictly positive probability to every pure strategy.
   (Totally mixed strategies are important for equilibrium refinement such
   as trembling hand perfect equilibrium.)

Mixed strategy[edit]

Illustration[edit]

   In a soccer penalty kick, the kicker must choose whether to kick to the
   right or left side of the goal, and simultaneously the goalie must
   decide which way to block it. Also, the kicker has a direction they are
   best at shooting, which is left if they are right-footed. The matrix
   for the soccer GAME illustrates this situation, a simplified form of
   the GAME studied by Chiappori, Levitt, and Groseclose (2002).^[3] It
   assumes that if the goalie guesses correctly, the kick is blocked,
   which is set to the base payoff of 0 for both players. If the goalie
   guesses wrong, the kick is more likely to go in if it is to the left
   (payoffs of +2 for the kicker and -2 for the goalie) than if it is to
   the right (the lower payoff of +1 to kicker and -1 to goalie).
                              Goalie
                     Lean Left Lean Right
   Kicker Kick Left   0,  0    +2, -2
          Kick Right +1, -1     0,  0
    Payoff for the Soccer GAME (Kicker, Goalie)

   This GAME has no pure-strategy equilibrium, because one player or the
   other would deviate from any profile of strategies—for example, (Left,
   Left) is not an equilibrium because the Kicker would deviate to Right
   and increase his payoff from 0 to 1.

   The kicker's mixed-strategy equilibrium is found from the fact that
   they will deviate from randomizing unless their payoffs from Left Kick
   and Right Kick are exactly equal. If the goalie leans left with
   probability g, the kicker's expected payoff from Kick Left is g(0) +
   (1-g)(2), and from Kick Right is g(1) + (1-g)(0). Equating these yields
   g= 2/3. Similarly, the goalie is willing to randomize only if the
   kicker chooses mixed strategy probability k such that Lean Left's
   payoff of k(0) + (1-k)(-1) equals Lean Right's payoff of k(-2) +
   (1-k)(0), so k = 1/3. Thus, the mixed-strategy equilibrium is
   (Prob(Kick Left) = 1/3, Prob(Lean Left) = 2/3).

   Note that in equilibrium, the kicker kicks to their best side only 1/3
   of the time. That is because the goalie is guarding that side more.
   Also note that in equilibrium, the kicker is indifferent which way they
   kick, but for it to be an equilibrium they must choose exactly 1/3
   probability.

   Chiappori, Levitt, and Groseclose try to measure how important it is
   for the kicker to kick to their favored side, add center kicks, etc.,
   and look at how professional players actually behave. They find that
   they do randomize, and that kickers kick to their favored side 45% of
   the time and goalies lean to that side 57% of the time. Their article
   is well-known as an example of how people in real life use mixed
   strategies.

Significance[edit]

   In his famous paper, John Forbes Nash proved that there is an
   equilibrium for every finite GAME. One can divide Nash equilibria into
   two types. Pure strategy Nash equilibria are Nash equilibria where all
   players are playing pure strategies. Mixed strategy Nash equilibria are
   equilibria where at least one player is playing a mixed strategy. While
   Nash proved that every finite GAME has a Nash equilibrium, not all have
   pure strategy Nash equilibria. For an example of a GAME that does not
   have a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies, see Matching pennies.
   However, many GAME do have pure strategy Nash equilibria (e.g. the
   Coordination GAME, the Prisoner's dilemma, the Stag hunt). Further,
   GAME can have both pure strategy and mixed strategy equilibria. An
   easy example is the pure coordination GAME, where in addition to the
   pure strategies (A,A) and (B,B) a mixed equilibrium exists in which
   both players play either strategy with probability 1/2.

Interpretations of mixed strategies[edit]

   During the 1980s, the concept of mixed strategies came under heavy fire
   for being "intuitively problematic", since they are weak Nash
   equilibria, and a player is indifferent about whether to follow their
   equilibrium strategy probability or deviate to some other
   probability.^[4] ^[5] GAME theorist Ariel Rubinstein describes
   alternative ways of understanding the concept. The first, due to
   Harsanyi (1973),^[6] is called purification, and supposes that the
   mixed strategies interpretation merely reflects our lack of knowledge
   of the players' information and decision-making process. Apparently
   random choices are then seen as consequences of non-specified,
   payoff-irrelevant exogenous factors.^[5] A second interpretation
   imagines the GAME players standing for a large population of agents.
   Each of the agents chooses a pure strategy, and the payoff depends on
   the fraction of agents choosing each strategy. The mixed strategy hence
   represents the distribution of pure strategies chosen by each
   population. However, this does not provide any justification for the
   case when players are individual agents.

   Later, Aumann and Brandenburger (1995),^[7] re-interpreted Nash
   equilibrium as an equilibrium in beliefs, rather than actions. For
   instance, in rock paper scissors an equilibrium in beliefs would have
   each player believing the other was equally likely to play each
   strategy. This interpretation weakens the descriptive power of Nash
   equilibrium, however, since it is possible in such an equilibrium for
   each player to actually play a pure strategy of Rock in each play of
   the GAME, even though over time the probabilities are those of the
   mixed strategy.

Behavior strategy[edit]

   While a mixed strategy assigns a probability distribution over pure
   strategies, a behavior strategy assigns at each information set a
   probability distribution over the set of possible actions. While the
   two concepts are very closely related in the context of normal form
   GAME, they have very different implications for extensive form GAME.
   Roughly, a mixed strategy randomly chooses a deterministic path through
   the GAME tree, while a behavior strategy can be seen as a stochastic
   path. The relationship between mixed and behavior strategies is the
   subject of Kuhn's theorem, a behavioral outlook on traditional
   GAME-theoretic hypotheses. The result establishes that in any finite
   extensive-form GAME with perfect recall, for any player and any mixed
   strategy, there exists a behavior strategy that, against all profiles
   of strategies (of other players), induces the same distribution over
   terminal nodes as the mixed strategy does. The converse is also true.

   A famous example of why perfect recall is required for the equivalence
   is given by Piccione and Rubinstein (1997)^[full citation needed] with
   their Absent-Minded Driver GAME.

Outcome equivalence[edit]

   Outcome equivalence combines the mixed and behavioral strategy of
   Player i in relation to the pure strategy of Player i’s opponent.
   Outcome equivalence is defined as the situation in which, for any mixed
   and behavioral strategy that Player i takes, in response to any pure
   strategy that Player I’s opponent plays, the outcome distribution of
   the mixed and behavioral strategy must be equal. This equivalence can
   be described by the following formula: (Q^(U(i), S(-i)))(z) = (Q^(β(i),
   S(-i)))(z), where U(i) describes Player i's mixed strategy, β(i)
   describes Player i's behavioral strategy, and S(-i) is the opponent's
   strategy.^[8]

Strategy with perfect recall[edit]

   Perfect recall is defined as the ability of every player in GAME to
   remember and recall all past actions within the GAME. Perfect recall is
   required for equivalence as, in finite GAME with imperfect recall,
   there will be existing mixed strategies of Player I in which there is
   no equivalent behavior strategy. This is fully described in the
   Absent-Minded Driver GAME formulated by Piccione and Rubinstein. In
   short, this GAME is based on the decision-making of a driver with
   imperfect recall, who needs to take the second exit off the highway to
   reach home but does not remember which intersection they are at when
   they reach it. Figure [2] describes this GAME.

   Without perfect information (i.e. imperfect information), players make
   a choice at each decision node without knowledge of the decisions that
   have preceded it. Therefore, a player’s mixed strategy can produce
   outcomes that their behavioral strategy cannot, and vice versa. This is
   demonstrated in the Absent-minded Driver GAME. With perfect recall and
   information, the driver has a single pure strategy, which is [continue,
   exit], as the driver is aware of what intersection (or decision node)
   they are at when they arrive to it. On the other hand, looking at the
   planning-optimal stage only, the maximum payoff is achieved by
   continuing at both intersections, maximized at p=2/3 (reference). This
   simple one player GAME demonstrates the importance of perfect recall
   for outcome equivalence, and its impact on normal and extended form
   GAME.^[9]

   Although they are something that many people experience when growing
   up, drinking GAME are far from being harmless fun. Taking part could
   mean you end up drinking a lot more than you intend, more quickly,
   increasing your risk of accidents and alcohol poisoning – which can be
   fatal.

   Read on to find out more about why drinking GAME can be dangerous, and
   how to stay in control.

Who plays drinking GAME, when and why?

   Any kind of drinking GAME - whether it’s based on gambling, chance, a
   ‘forfeit’ for breaking rules, or a competition – can mean people those
   taking part drink more than they want, faster than they intend. If you
   take part in one, you’re giving up control over how much alcohol you
   drink – and the risks increase the more you drink.

   Drinking GAME are common among young adults, with peer pressure to fit
   in commonly given as a reason for taking part.

   Drinkaware research from 2019^1 found that 60% of 18-34 year-olds
   believe peer pressure to drink is common among them, with this age
   group also the most likely to say they have drunk more than they
   expected to ‘keep up’ with others (47% said they had done this). But,
   as we’re social creatures, peer pressure can affect anyone of any age.

   And if drinking GAME are played as part of ‘pre-loading’ (drinking
   before going out) they are associated with higher levels of alcohol
   consumption, and greater risk.^2 Find out more on our binge drinking
   page.

   Freshers’ week survival guide

Risks of drinking GAME

   Drinking alcohol very quickly – whether as part of a drinking GAME or
   not - can lead to acute alcohol poisoning, which can be extremely
   dangerous.

   There is no minimum amount of alcohol that can cause alcohol poisoning.
   It depends on a person’s age, sex, size, weight, how fast they have
   been drinking, how much they have eaten, their general health and
   whether they have taken medication or drugs.

   Tragically, acute alcohol poisoning was the cause of 552 deaths in the
   UK during 2020.^3

   If you recognise the symptoms of alcohol poisoning – which include
   confusion, vomiting or seizures – call 999 immediately – you could save
   someone’s life.

   Drinking alcohol impairs your judgement, balance and
   coordination^4 making it more likely you will be involved in an
   accident, with the risk increasing the more you drink.

   And the way that alcohol suppresses activity in parts of the brain
   associated with inhibition^5 means you’re more likely to make a
   decision you regret, whether this means walking home alone, having
   unprotected sex, or not being able to look out for friends, drinking
   GAME present real dangers.

   Binge drinking increases the likelihood of both becoming aggressive or
   angry and also a victim of violence, including sexual violence and
   domestic abuse.^6

Plan ahead

   If you’re worried you might be talked into a drink when you don’t want
   to, plan ahead for those moments and think about what you want to say.
   Combatting peer pressure means sticking to your guns in the moment – it
   might be hard, but it’s worthwhile.

   Tools to reduce your drinking

Socialise socially

   One in ten 18-34 year old drinkers say they’ve lost a friendship
   because of the pressure from someone – or the pressure they’ve put on
   someone – to drink alcohol. Speaking up might help someone else, as
   well as yourself.^7

   Beat peer pressure

Find your group

   Nearly one in six 16- to 24-year-olds in the UK (16%) say they don’t
   drink at all^8 – it can be a great choice to have an active social
   life.

   How to stop drinking completely

Be kind to your future self

   Opting out of a drinking GAME will lower your risk of alcohol
   poisoning. It could also help you avoid a hangover, or making a
   decision you might regret – like texting an ex- or behaving in
   embarrassing ways that’ll be all over social media the next morning.

   Worried you’re drinking more than before?

Control your wallet

   Drinking GAME can be very expensive – buying huge rounds at the bar
   can rapidly burn through your money. Put the money you save towards a
   treat for yourself.

   Ideas for drink-free days

Drinking GAME and the UK low risk drinking guidelines

   The UK Chief Medical Officers’ (CMO) low risk drinking
   guidelines recommend you should limit the total amount of alcohol you
   drink on any single occasion. You can also keep your short-term risks
   low by drinking more slowly, drinking with food, alternating any
   alcoholic drinks with water and planning ahead to avoid problems.

   Getting involved in drinking GAME can seriously speed up the rate you
   drink so you’re more likely to exceed the guidelines.

   The long-term risks of alcohol-related health problems also mean the
   CMOs recommend that it’s safest for both men and women to drink no more
   than 14 units a week, spread over three or more days with several
   drink-free days, and no bingeing.

   Following the low risk drinking guidelines and avoiding drinking GAME
   can help keep your risk low from accidents and injuries, physical or
   sexual abuse, alcohol poisoning and a range of long-term health
   conditions – including seven types of cancer, heart disease, high blood
   pressure, diabetes liver disease and mental health problems.

How to Win the Blame GAME

   People are often more concerned about avoiding blame than achieving
   results. But blame can actually be a potent positive force in the
   workplace. The trick, says this former Major League Baseball pitcher,
   is knowing how to use it.

   When a new product flops in the marketplace or a recent hire turns out
   to be the employee from hell, blaming somebody for the mistake seems,
   well, just a tad rude. So people talk politely around the blunder,
   saying things like “sales targets were missed” or “mistakes occurred,”
   as if the error happened all by itself. Indeed, at many companies,
   blame is the proverbial elephant in the middle of the room that people
   pretend isn’t there. At other organizations, people are all too quick
   to point fingers, leaving employees more concerned about avoiding blame
   than about achieving results. Such organizations, ruled by “CYA,” have
   given blame a bum rap.

What Is the Most Dangerous GAME Parents Must Know?

          + 11 dangerous GAME parents should know about

   dangerous GAME parents should know about
   Children are especially vulnerable to the dangers of risky GAME and
   challenges online

   The internet is amazing and scary in equal parts. We live in a time
   when every kid has access to smartphones, tablets, and laptops, and it
   is a real challenge to monitor your child’s digital footprint.

   Every time your child is online, there is a potential threat to their
   privacy, as well as yours. Many online sites and GAME can digitally
   tracking your location, which can be misused by cybercriminals and
   perpetrators of child abuse.

   However, something that parents may not be aware of is that there are
   tons of challenges and GAME on social media, where kids are encouraged
   to engage in extremely dangerous behavior. It’s important to take
   necessary precautions to protect your kids:
     * Educate them about online predators and teaching them to avoid
       entering personal details over the internet
     * Disable access to dangerous sites
     * Keep sharp or harmful objects away from them

   The first step, though, is knowing which GAME are the most popular.

11 dangerous GAME parents should know about

Blue Whale challenge

   This is an online suicide GAME led by a social media group where
   administrators ask children and teenagers to take on a series of
   challenges that end with them eventually killing themselves. This GAME
   is responsible for hundreds of teen suicides worldwide. Players are
   required to do a series of bizarre tasks in 50 days, putting peer
   pressure on players to get them to go all the way to the end.

   A 21-year-old Russian, Philipp Budeikin, was found to be the mastermind
   behind this GAME and was arrested. However, some suspect that the GAME
   still exists and is being managed by other people

Choking GAME

   Also known as the fainting GAME, the choking GAME is where children and
   teens strangle themselves or strangle each other on video. The GAME is
   meant to cause deprivation of oxygen to the brain resulting in a
   feeling of being  high (similar to alcohol or recreational drugs),
   light-headedness, dizziness, or temporary unconsciousness. However,
   this is very dangerous, and several deaths have occurred because of
   this challenge.

Gallon challenge

   This challenge involves consuming a large amount of milk (usually about
   one gallon or 3.8 L of whole milk) within a set period of time.
   Drinking a gallon of any type of fluid so fast in such a short time
   frame can be dangerous. Anybody trying this challenge may accidentally
   aspirate (inhale) the fluid causing lung complications or vomiting.

Cinnamon challenge

   This challenge involves eating a spoonful of cinnamon without drinking
   water for 60 seconds on video. Although this may sound harmless,
   cinnamon dust can enter the lungs and cause severe damage. It can also
   cause dryness of the mouth, choking, throat irritation, breathing
   difficulties, and even lung collapse. The cinnamon challenge has led to
   many hospitalizations.

Tide pod challenge

   This challenge involves biting down on a brightly colored laundry
   detergent packet and spitting out or ingesting its contents. This GAME
   began as a joke with children, but it can cause serious health
   problems, especially if they swallow the detergent. Tide pods are
   brightly colored and look like candy. Children are attracted to such
   products and may ingest them accidentally, even outside the GAME. It is
   therefore best to keep these items out of your child’s reach.

Fire Fairy

   This is an online prank that targets younger children, giving them
   dangerous instructions such as turning on gas in the stove at midnight
   when nobody is awake and then going back to sleep. The GAME promises
   children that if they do this, they will wake up and become fire
   fairies. This GAME has resulted in fires and serious burn injuries in
   children.

Mariam’s GAME

   This is an online GAME that revolves around a child lost in the forest
   who asks players to help find her way back home. The GAME has
   frightening audio and visual sound effects. Players are asked a series
   of personal questions as they accompany the little girl home. This is
   dangerous because children often reveal their personal information that
   can be misused by hackers and cybercriminals.

Five-finger fillet

   This is a GAME that involves stabbing a knife between each finger,
   really fast, with the goal of not hitting any finger. However, this has
   resulted in serious hand injuries in many people, including older teens
   and adults.

Cutting challenge

   This is an online GAME that encourages children and teens to cut their
   own arms, legs, or other body parts with a razor blade or knife.
   Following this, they need to take pictures, show their friends or post
   it on social media.

Salt and ice challenge

   This is a self-harming challenge that asks people to put salt on their
   skin and then place ice on the area. This causes a burning feeling and
   pain similar to frostbite. The goal is to see who can tolerate pain for
   the longest time and then post the video on YouTube or other social
   media sites. The combination of ice and salt creates a chemical
   reaction where the mixture gets as cold as −64.4 degrees F and burns
   through the skin, resulting in serious injuries.

Charlie Charlie

   Charlie Charlie, an urban legend GAME, has gained some popularity due
   to social media stars filming themselves playing it. The concept is
   similar to an Ouija board:
     * A White piece of paper with four quadrants drawn on it is placed on
       a table.
     * Two quadrants are labeled yes and the other two are labeled no.
     * Two pencils are placed over each other and over the lines drawn to
       make the quadrants.
     * “Demon Charlie” is then asked questions, which is supposed to cause
       the pencils to move to either yes or no.

   According to the legend, Charlie continues to haunt them, especially if
   they don’t say good-bye properly at the end. The pencils typically move
   because of a breeze or other children trying to shake them.

   Although the GAME does not cause any physical danger, it can deeply
   affect children’s mental health. Fear of ghosts and demons causes many
   children to become scared, have night terrors and insomnia, wet the
   bed, etc., and overall negatively affect their mental and physical
   well-being.

   Common pheasant, widely introduced and hunted as GAME

   GAME or quarry is any wild animal hunted for animal products (primarily
   meat), for recreation ("sporting"), or for trophies.^[1] The species of
   animals hunted as GAME varies in different parts of the world and by
   different local jurisdictions, though most are terrestrial mammals and
   birds. Fish caught non-commercially (recreational fishing) are also
   referred to as GAME fish.

By continent and region[edit]

   This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this
   section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may
   be challenged and removed. (May 2021) (Learn how and when to remove
   this template message)

   The range of animal species hunted by humans varies in different parts
   of the world. This is influenced by climate, faunal diversity, popular
   taste and locally accepted views about what can or cannot be
   legitimately hunted. Sometimes a distinction is also made between
   varieties and breeds of a particular animal, such as wild turkey and
   domestic turkey. The flesh of the animal, when butchered for
   consumption, is often described as having a "gamey" flavour. This
   difference in taste can be attributed to the natural diet of the
   animal, which usually results in a lower fat content compared to
   domestic farm-raised animals.

   In some countries, GAME is classified, including legal classifications
   with respect to licenses required, as either "small GAME" or "large
   GAME". A single small GAME licence may cover all small GAME species and
   be subject to yearly bag limits. Large GAME are often subject to
   individual licensing where a separate permit is required for each
   individual animal taken (tags).

   and local guides with his kill, 1970

   In some parts of Africa, wild animals hunted for their meat are called
   bushmeat; see that article for more detailed information on how this
   operates within the economy (for personal consumption and for money)
   and the law (including overexploitation and illegal imports). Animals
   hunted for bushmeat include, but are not limited to:
     * Various species of antelope, including duikers
     * Various species of primates like mandrills or gorillas
     * Rodents like porcupines or cane rats

   Some of these animals are endangered or otherwise protected, and thus
   it is illegal to hunt them.

   In Africa, animals hunted for their pelts or ivory are sometimes
   referred to as big GAME.

   Also see the legal definition of GAME in Eswatini.^[2]

South Africa[edit]

   South Africa is a famous destination for GAME hunting, with its large
   biodiversity and therefore impressive variety of GAME species. Many
   creatures have returned to former areas from which they were once taken
   as a result of being killed for big-GAME hunting. Commonly hunted
   species include:
     * Springbok
     * Impala
     * Steenbok
     * Oribi
     * Bushbuck
     * Nyala
     * Greater Kudu
     * Common Eland
     * Blue Wildebeest
     * Black Wildebeest
     * Blesbok
     * Bontebok
     * Sable Antelope
     * Roan Antelope
     * Gemsbok
     * Giraffe
     * Cape Buffalo
     * Southern White Rhinoceros
     * Plains Zebra

   South Africa also has 62 species of gamebirds, including guineafowl,
   francolin, partridge, quail, sandgrouse, duck, geese, snipe, bustard
   and korhaan. Some of these species are no longer hunted, and of the 44
   indigenous gamebirds that can potentially be utilised in South Africa,
   only three, namely the yellow-throated sandgrouse, Delegorgue's pigeon
   and the African pygmy goose warrant special protection. Of the
   remaining 41 species, 24 have shown an increase in numbers and
   distribution range in the last 25 years or so. The status of 14 species
   appears unchanged, with insufficient information being available for
   the remaining three species. The gamebirds of South Africa where the
   population status in 2005 was secure or growing are listed below:
     * Helmeted guineafowl
     * Greywing partridge
     * Redwing partridge
     * Orange River partridge

   In the UK GAME is defined in law by the GAME Act 1831. It is illegal to
   shoot GAME on Sundays or at night. Other non-GAME birds that are hunted
   for food in the UK are specified under the Wildlife and Countryside Act
   1981. UK law defines GAME as including:
     * Black grouse (No longer hunted due to decline in numbers)
     * Red grouse
     * Brown hare
     * Rock ptarmigan
     * Grey and red-legged partridges
     * Common pheasant

   Deer are not included in the definition, but similar controls provided
   to those in the GAME Act apply to deer (from the Deer Act 1991). Deer
   hunted in the UK are:
     * Red deer
     * Roe deer
     * Fallow deer
     * Sika deer
     * Muntjac deer
     * Chinese water deer
     * and hybrids of these deer

   Other animals which are hunted in the UK include:
     * Duck, including mallard, tufted duck, teal, northern pintail and
       common pochard
     * Goose, including greylag goose, Canada goose and pink-footed goose
     * Wood pigeon
     * Cuckoo
     * Eurasian woodcock
     * Common snipe
     * Rabbit
     * Eurasian golden plover
     * Corncrake

   Capercaillie are not currently hunted in the UK because of a recent
   decline in numbers and conservation projects towards their recovery.
   The ban is generally considered voluntary on private lands, and few
   birds live away from RSPB or Forestry Commission land allegedly.

   GAME meat is typically taken from a wild animal that has been shot with
   a gun or bow. Hunters must be absolutely certain of their target before
   shooting and should make every effort to get the animal down as quickly
   and painlessly as possible. Once obtained, GAME meat must be processed
   to avoid spoiling. The method of processing varies by GAME species and
   size. Small GAME and fowl may simply be carried home to be butchered.
   Large GAME such as deer is quickly field-dressed by removing the
   viscera in the field, while very large animals like moose may be
   partially butchered in the field because of the difficulty of removing
   them intact from their habitat. Commercial processors often handle deer
   taken during deer seasons, sometimes even at supermarket meat counters.
   Otherwise the hunter handles butchering. The carcass is kept cool to
   minimize spoilage.

   Traditionally, GAME meat was hung until "high" or "gamey", that is,
   approaching a state of decomposition.^[4] However, this adds to the
   risk of contamination. Small GAME can be processed essentially intact,
   after gutting and skinning or defeathering (by species). Small animals
   are ready for cooking, although they may be disjointed first. Large
   GAME must be processed by techniques commonly practiced by commercial
   butchers.

Cooking[edit]

   Wikibooks Cookbook has a recipe/module on
     * GAME

   Generally GAME is cooked in the same ways as farmed meat.^[5] Because
   some GAME meat is leaner than store-bought beef, overcooking is a
   common mishap which can be avoided if properly prepared.^[6]^[7] It is
   sometimes grilled or cooked longer or by slow cooking or moist-heat
   methods to make it more tender, since some GAME tends to be tougher
   than farm-raised meat. Other methods of tenderizing include marinating
   as in the dish Hasenpfeffer, cooking in a GAME pie or as a stew such as
   burgoo.

Safety[edit]

   The Norwegian Food Safety Authority considers that children, pregnant
   women, fertile-aged women, and people with high blood pressure should
   not consume GAME shot with lead-based ammunition more than once a
   month. Children who often eat such GAME might develop a slightly lower
   IQ, as lead influences the development of the central nervous
   system.^[8]

   become a little tired. We have a suggestion for making your meals a
   little different and possibly even more delicious: Bring GAME meat to
   your dining room table.

   In addition to lamb, beef, pork, and poultry, numerous meat-centric
   wholesalers and retailers around the country also offer wild and
   farm-raised GAME meats. GAME meats are usually categorized as the
   following:
     * Winged GAME, such as quail, duck, and pheasant.
     * Ground GAME, such as hare and rabbit.
     * Big GAME, such as bison, venison, elk, and wild boar.

   They're not only interesting from a culinary perspective but are
   uniquely sustainable proteins. GAME meats are primarily raised on
   pasture, which is better for the planet, requiring fewer natural
   resources to raise. They provide lean, high-quality, nutrient-rich
   protein that's free of antibiotics and adds much-needed diversity to
   our diets.

   This feature highlights some of our favorite GAME meats and how they
   can be used as alternatives to the common center-of-the-plate proteins
   such as poultry, pork, and beef.
   The Best Places to Order Meat Online for Convenient Deliveries

Instead of Poultry, Try…

Pheasant

   Pheasant is one of the most approachable GAME birds, perfect for those
   new to the world of GAME meats. Similar to the size of a chicken, a
   whole pheasant averages about 2 to 3 pounds. It has lean meat that is
   full of flavor, making it a great alternative to chicken and
   turkey. Its smaller size is perfect for smaller holiday celebrations or
   meals, when preparing a whole turkey may seem like overkill, but you
   want something more celebratory and special than chicken. Pheasant also
   makes incredible sausage, the perfect complement to traditional
   stuffing in place of traditional Italian sausage.

   How to Prepare

   Roast it whole or prepare the breast and legs separately. Because it is
   a lean meat, moisture needs to be added to the cooking process—it is
   prepared best using low heat to prevent it from drying out. For
   example, if oven or pan roasting (both dry heat methods), rub the bird
   with butter or oil and baste while roasting, similar to a whole turkey
   or pan-roasted chicken breasts. Alternatively, pheasant can be prepared
   in a quick braise, adding more moisture to the meat from the braising
   liquid.

   Flavor Pairings

   Go with fruits such as apple, oranges, and prunes, sweet cooking wine
   or liquor like port or cognac, and fall spices and aromatics, such as
   sage and thyme.

Squab

   Smaller than pheasant and often called a young pigeon, squab is a GAME
   bird usually only about 1 pound or less in size. Unlike pheasant, its
   meat throughout is a red dark meat (similar to duck or dark meat
   turkey), slightly gamy in flavor, and incredibly tender and delicious.
   One whole roasted bird is just right for a single-serving entrée, or
   several can be prepared for a small holiday feast.

   How to Prepare

   Squab is best prepared medium-rare to medium, similar to other red
   meats, and can be prepared in a variety of ways, including roasted, pan
   roasted, or grilled. There is only a small amount of meat in the legs
   (most is in the breasts), and because of its small size, it is
   typically prepared as a whole bird. Brushing with fat before grilling
   or basting while roasting is recommended to help prevent the lean meat
   from becoming dry, particularly if you are preparing it more
   well-done.

   Flavor Pairings

   Fruit such as pears, apples, grapes, figs, and prunes; sweet vinegars
   such as balsamic vinegar or fig vinegar; and tender root vegetables
   such as baby turnips, beets, and carrots all pair nicely with squab.

Quail

   As the smallest of the GAME birds on this list, quail is another great
   substitute for poultry. Its meat looks very similar to chicken but more
   intense and pronounced in flavor. Typically weighing just 4 to 6
   ounces, one whole quail is just the right size for an appetizer or
   small entrée. Quail would also be perfect served family style among
   other plentiful sides. There are different breeds of quail, all
   relatively the same size with the exception of the Jumbo Brown Coturnix
   Quail, which is known for its meatiness compared to other breeds as it
   is nearly double the size of an average quail.

   How to Prepare

   Quail can be purchased whole or semi-boneless—both ideal for stuffing
   and roasting—resulting in a beautiful presentation. Whole quail can
   also be flavored with a short marinade and then spatchcocked and
   grilled, oven roasted, and even fried, while quail breasts or legs can
   be simply pan roasted.

   Like other GAME birds, the meat is lean. While it should be cooked
   through until juices run clear, it cooks very quickly and can become
   dry if overcooked; basting or brushing with fat will help retain
   moisture. Because of their small size, quail is one of the easiest and
   fastest GAME birds to prepare, and it is also incredibly versatile.

   Flavor Pairings

   Opt for winter citrus, grapes, tart dried fruit such as cranberries or
   goji berries, pomegranate; sweet cooking wine or liquor like port,
   sherry, or cognac; BBQ flavors, fall spices, cumin, coriander, honey,
   or maple.

Instead of Beef, Try…

Bison

   For someone new to GAME meat, one of the easiest ways to get an
   introduction is by substituting a favorite beef dish with
   bison. Although very similar to cattle in its nature, farmed bison does
   not come with the same concerns around antibiotics (they're not
   routinely used); is a nutritious, sustainable substitute for beef
   (particularly when 100 percent grass fed); and has a unique earthy
   flavor with a subtly sweet finish that may convert you for good.

   Bison steaks, tenderloin, short ribs, stew meat, and ground meat are
   all ideal for swapping in place of beef. At the holiday table, bison
   can take its place center stage in the form of a roast, stew, braise,
   or delicious grilled steak. Or it can be incorporated into elegant hors
   d'oeuvres—for example, braised bison short rib crostini or bison
   carpaccio.

   How to Prepare

   Bison should be prepared similarly to beef with different cooking
   methods according to the cut. It can be used ground or in whole cuts,
   which can be grilled, braised, and more.

   Flavor Pairings

   Use earthy flavors such as mushrooms, root vegetables such as beets,
   turnips, parsnips, carrots, and rutabaga; caramelized onion and roasted
   garlic; savory herbs and spices such as rosemary, thyme, and black
   pepper, as well as parsley and cilantro.

Venison

   Perhaps one of the more familiar GAME meats, venison refers to the meat
   from deer. Although hunting for deer is legal in certain areas and at
   certain times of the year, the venison available for purchase from
   commercial retailers is farm raised on commercial ranches.
   Historically, venison was known for its strong gamy flavor, but the
   venison from farm-raised animals is much less gamy than the meat from
   hunted animals due to their consistent diet. Its iron-rich red meat can
   be prepared in a variety of ways similar to beef and is extremely
   versatile. Unlike beef, it does not have fat marbled throughout and is
   extremely lean, which is important to keep in mind when preparing since
   it can get tough if overcooked.

   How to Prepare

   Venison is the perfect special occasion meat for a table centerpiece
   and nearly every cut of venison can be used as a swap for beef. For
   real holiday showstoppers, replace beef with venison in celebratory
   dishes like beef Wellington or osso buco or even a straightforward
   venison strip loin or roast in place of beef tenderloin or pot roast.
   For something more rustic, use venison stew meat and make a hunter's
   stew. Or use ground venison in a traditional meat pie. Note: Elk is
   often described interchangeably with venison; while they are not the
   same animal, they are both in the deer family, and elk can be used in
   place of venison in any recipe due to its similarities.

   Flavor Pairings

   Fruits including blueberries, cherries, cranberries, pomegranate, and
   dates; hearty vegetables including winter squash and root vegetables as
   well as mushrooms; aromatics such as savory, thyme, sage, juniper
   berries, black pepper, and even cocoa powder all pair nicely with
   venison.

Instead of Pork, Try...

Wild Boar

   One of the wildest of the GAME meats, wild boar is one of the oldest
   species in existence, dating back to before the Ice Age. Native wild
   boar is found in various regions throughout the world and has been a
   predominant part of numerous global cuisines. In the U.S., the majority
   of wild boar is pasture raised, although some are still humanely
   trapped in the wild. Although it is an ancestor of the pig, its meat is
   much leaner and darker than pork and has a much sweeter flavor due to
   its wild diet of acorns, nuts, and natural forage.

   How to Prepare

   Similar to other GAME meats, wild boar is best cooked gently over low
   heat and, if using a dry heat method, not overcooked. Instead of a
   crown pork roast, make a crown wild boar rack. Instead of Christmas
   ham, try wild boar shoulder roast. Instead of pork tenderloin? You
   guessed it, swap with wild boar tenderloin. And for smaller gatherings,
   look for a wild boar mini roast that will feed three to four people,
   making it perfect for a meal for two (plus some bonus
   leftovers). Similar to venison and bison, wild boar can also be used in
   winter stews—opt for braising cuts like shoulder or stew meat for this
   preparation and cook low and slow.

   Flavor Pairings

   Ingredients with robust flavors, such as cooked tomatoes, mushrooms,
   onions, root vegetables, red wine, and aromatics such as rosemary,
   sage, and thyme are all-natural pairings for wild boar.

Archery Hunting for Small GAME

   (BUTTON) Be the first to comment
   Archery Hunting for Small GAME
   Steven Rinella
   Steven Rinella May 14, 2018

   Unlike big GAME hunting, where there are typically separate seasons for
   firearms and archery equipment, there are no legal incentives to hunt
   small GAME with a bow. There are a few exceptions to this rule,
   including an archery-only duck hunt on a coastal refuge in the vicinity
   of Anchorage, Alaska. That alone should make you interested in archery
   equipment.

   Instead, the decision to hunt small GAME with a bow typically comes
   down to personal aesthetics. Some hunters value a challenge as much or
   more as they value wild meat, and the thrill of hitting, or trying to
   hit, a flying bird or running rabbit with an arrow is too much to
   resist. My own father was such a guy. Over the years, he managed to
   kill many cottontails, squirrels, and grouse with his bow, as well as
   pheasants and ducks hit it in midair flight.

   Bow Hunting Philosophy
   My personal philosophy on bow selection is identical to my philosophy
   on rifles and shotguns. That is, I’m looking for a versatile hunting
   tool that can handle a wide variety of species under ever-shifting sets
   of circumstances be it calling javelina in the desert, perched high in
   a Midwest oak tree for whitetail deer, or still-hunting a Northern
   spruce forest for snowshoe hares.

   Nothing will meet these all of these challenges as efficiently as a
   fast-shooting compound bow. What’s more, by using the same bow for both
   big GAME and small GAME hunting, you’ll be practicing for big GAME
   hunting while chasing small GAME, and vice-versa.

   Traditional vs Compound
   But if you’re considering a bow purchase strictly for small GAME, and
   more particularly for flushed rabbits and GAME birds, you should
   consider going with a traditional recurve or longbow that will allow
   you to take snapshots at the fast-moving GAME. A compound bow must be
   held at full draw to aim and fire; this takes time and prevents snap
   shooting. Here are some additional pros and cons to consider when
   purchasing a bow that you’ll use for small GAME hunting.
   Top: Compound bow. This is a Hoyt Carbon Spyder with Easton Full Metal
   Jacket Arrow and a Wasp Archery fixed blade broadhead. Bottom: A
   traditional bow. Shown here is a Hoyt Tiburon recurve with High Plains
   Hunter arrow and Judo small GAME point.

   Compound Bow
   Pros: More accurate than traditional bows at longer ranges; it’s far
   easier to gain a comfortable level of proficiency with a compound than
   it is with a traditional bow .

   Cons: The increased speed of the arrow causes greater damage to the
   arrow as it deflects off of the ground and rocks after a miss, which
   can be common with small, fast-moving targets;  compounds are heavier
   than a traditional bows, and they can become a burden on long hikes;
   compound bows have many moving parts and require more maintenance than
   traditional bows.

   Traditional Bow
   Pros: Light, easy to carry; because the arrow is traveling slower, it
   can absorb the impact from errant shots and be used again; shots can be
   fired very quickly.

   Cons: Difficult to master; limited efficacy at longer ranges.

   It’s been speculated by anthropologists that human language came as a
   result of our need to organize hunting activities. As hunters, we rely
   on a commonality of terms in order to share information, swap stories,
   and ask questions. When one of us says something, it’s helpful if the
   rest of us knows what they’re talking about. To that end, here’s a
   basic rundown of methods and strategies used by small GAME hunters:

   You made the shot, and the bird crumpled and fell toward the ground. If
   you’re lucky, recovery will be as simple as walking over there and
   picking it up. Often, though, things are much more tricky than that.
   Recovery can be hard, time-consuming work when hunting in brushy or
   swampy areas where downed small GAME can be hidden from sight. Here are
   some tips to help you recover more GAME and bring more meat to the

   For whatever reason, it seems as though big GAME hunters are far more
   likely than small GAME hunters to hit the road and spend a few nights
   camping out in the field. That’s too bad, because road trips can be
   extremely productive for small GAME hunting, especially when you travel
   to areas that receive very little hunting pressure. At various points
   in our lives, my brothers and I have done annual road trips for
   cottontail rabbits, quail, ducks...

   young hunter kneeling next to giant black ox No, a dangerous GAME rifle
   does not have to cost as much as a used pickup truck. But, it does have
   to pack a punch and be every time, all the time, reliable. Richard Mann

   Regardless of what you’ve read, and what you might hear experts advise,
   the number one requirement of a dangerous GAME rifle is reliability. It
   can be exquisitely beautiful with engravings of naked concubines and
   vicious creatures, but if it does not work every time and all the time,
   it is not a dangerous GAME rifle.

   Many believe a rifle of this sort has to be expensive but that’s not
   the case. It only must work and deliver a hard enough hit to get the
   job done. Knowing those facts, if you can afford to hunt dangerous
   GAME, you can probably afford a reliable and (very) nice hard-hitting
   rifle. To help find one that’s right for you, here is a list of 20 of
   the finest dangerous GAME guns available, working from a beer to a
   champagne budget.
   Mossberg Patriot Laminate Marinecote rifle Mossberg Patriot Laminate
   Marinecote • Price: $629 Mossberg

   When most folks think of dangerous GAME rifles, they think of broken
   wallets and maxed-out credit cards. It doesn’t have to be that way.
   Mossberg’s Patriot Laminate is a rugged and reliable bolt-action rifle.
   It comes with open sights, a fantastically functional detachable
   magazine, and a great trigger. It’s also chambered for the .375 Ruger,
   which is all the gun you need for dangerous GAME, whether it be lions,
   tigers or bears.

   m/shop/en/browning-x-bolt-stainless-stalker-bolt-action-rifle-with-open
   -sights
   See It

   Drilled and tapped for scope mounting, but also fitted with adjustable
   open sights, and chambered for the most classic of all dangerous-GAME
   cartridges—the .375 H&ampH—this rifle is ready for rough country and
   perilous encounters. The stainless steel action and barrel are fitted
   to an ergonomic synthetic stock with checkered grip panels. It has a
   3-round magazine capacity and weighs only 6 pounds, 13 ounces, so those
   long treks on the track of buffalo won’t wear you out.
   CZ 550 American Safari Magnum rifle CZ 550 American Safari Magnum •
   Price: $1,215 CZ USA

   Built on CZ-USA’s famous 550 Magnum action, this rifle is intended for
   use with magnified optics, but back-up iron sights are there if needed.
   The stock has a high, flat comb to better aid eye alignment with both
   optics and irons, and the round forend won’t snag on brush while
   stalking. Many professional hunters prefer the 550’s Mauser-style
   extractor and fixed ejector, and the rifle is available for most of the
   hard-hitting big bore cartridges synonymous with dangerous GAME
   hunting.
   Ruger Hawkeye African rifle Ruger Hawkeye African • Price: $1,279 Ruger

   Loaded with features like a non-rotating Mauser-style extractor, fixed
   ejector, three-position safety, hinged floor plate, integral scope
   mounts, express style open sights, and the Ruger LC6 trigger, this
   rifle offers a lot for your money. And, to help control the big bang
   that comes from cartridges like the .375 and .416 Ruger, the muzzle is
   capped off with the removable Ruger Muzzle Brake System. This rifle
   looks as attractive as it’s price tag.

   Winchester Model 70 Safari Express rifle
   See It

   Available in .375 H&ampH, .416 Remington Magnum, and .458 Winchester
   Magnum, the Model 70 Safari Express is a fine representation of what
   many expect in a dangerous GAME rifle. The satin finished stock has cut
   checkering, the steel bottom metal is one-piece, and the pre-64
   Winchester action is one that is revered by African professional
   hunters. Modernizations include the M.O.A. Trigger System, with zero
   take-up, zero creep, and zero over travel for outstanding accuracy.
   Ruger No. 1 475 Linebaugh/480 Ruger Ruger No. 1 475 Linebaugh/480 Ruger
   (Lipsey’s) • Price: $1,919 Ruger

   Though this may not be the traditional action and cartridge associated
   with dangerous GAME hunting, the Ruger No. 1 offers a level of
   reliability and strength that is unmatched. And, the .475 Linebaugh
   cartridge will push a 370-grain bullet to almost 1,600 fps. The
   combination isn’t great for long range shots, but will knock down
   anything inside spitting distance.
   Marlin Custom Shop 1895 Modern Lever Hunter Marlin Custom Shop 1895
   Modern Lever Hunter • Price: $1,995 Marlin

   With three times the ammo capacity of a double rifle and faster
   follow-up shots than a bolt action, it could be argued that this fine
   quality .45-70 from the Marlin Custom Shop is ideal for dangerous GAME.
   Custom crafted to your color preferences, the action of this Marlin
   Model 1895 is smoothed to perfection, and all metal surfaces are coated
   with Cerakote. The XS Sights Lever Rail lets you choose between an
   aperture sight, a red dot, or a conventional or scout style scope.
   CZ Safari Classics Magnum Express Rifle CZ Safari Classics Magnum
   Express Rifle • Price: $2,271 CZ USA

   Available in .375 H&ampH, .404 Jeffery, .416 Remington, .416 Rigby, .450
   Rigby, .458 Winchester Magnum, .458 Lott, and a variety of other
   dinosaur killing cartridges, this rifle is built to your exact
   specifications. It features a single set trigger, matte or gloss blue
   finish, and a #1 Fancy American Walnut stock, with dual cross bolts and
   a straight comb. A muzzle brake, ebony forend, and a weather resistant
   coating are options, while the Mauser-style extractor and hammer-forged
   barrel are standard.
   Remington Model 700 Custom C Grade Remington Model 700 Custom C Grade •
   Price: $2,995 Remington

   Don’t let anyone tell you the push-feed Model 700 action is not up to
   the task when it comes to dangerous GAME hunting. Not only is it
   reliable, but you can drop a cartridge in the ejection port and close
   the bolt for a follow-up shot if you run the rifle dry—something most
   controlled-round-feed actions cannot do. A gloss finished, C-grade
   walnut stock, with contrasting grip and forend tips makes this a
   luxurious safari rifle.
   Weatherby Mark V Dangerous GAME Rifle Weatherby Mark V Dangerous GAME
   Rifle • Price: $3,600 Weatherby

   Weatherby is a brand synonymous with the African continent and
   high-dollar hunts. Their Dangerous GAME Rifle offers a sub-MOA accuracy
   guarantee, the Weatherby LXX trigger, a short 54-degree bolt lift, and
   the famous Weatherby Magnum 9-lug action. The action is bedded in a
   hand-laminated, composite stock, with a raised Monte Carlo comb, and is
   finished with spider web accents. It’s available in six Weatherby
   chamberings and .375 H&ampH.
   Dakota Arms Model 76 Safari Dakota Arms Model 76 Safari • Price: $8,900
   Dakota Arms

   Gorgeous and deadly might be the best way to describe this bolt-action
   rifle built for African safaris and dangerous GAME hunting. Constructed
   on the famous Dakota Model 76 action, it’s available for right or left
   hand shooters, with a XXX walnut stock, hand-cut checkering, ebony
   forend tip and barrel band in a variety of chamberings up to .458 Lott.
   Dakota Arms Professional Hunter rifle Dakota Arms Professional Hunter •
   Price: $8,000 Dakota Arms

   The brand new Professional Hunter from Dakota Arms features their
   respected Model 76 action and a custom fiberglass stock with pillar
   bedding. Designed for the dangerous GAME hunter who values ruggedness
   over beauty, the rifle’s 23-inch Premium Douglas barrel is Cerakoted
   and a quarter rib fixed sight and hooded fiber optic front sight are
   standard features. The cartridge options are vast and include the .450
   Dakota and .450 Rigby.
   Dakota Arms African Big Five Dakota Arms African Big Five • Price:
   $9,700 Dakota Arms

   An exquisite firearm by any measure, the Dakota Arms African Rifle is
   built on a stock made form XXX grade walnut, with a shadow line
   cheekpiece, and is detailed with hand-cut checkering. It features a
   straddle floorplate with an inside release and a drop-belly magazine
   with a four-round capacity. It’s available in a wide assortment of
   elephant-capable cartridges including the .450 Dakota.
   Heym “Express” Magnum Bolt Action Rifle Heym “Express” Magnum Bolt
   Action Rifle • Price: $13,000 Heym

   Elegance abounds with this bolt-action rifle from Heym. It is
   reminiscent of the best-grade English sporting rifles that were built
   between the great wars. The actions used are sized perfectly to the
   cartridge, with cartridge specific magazine boxes. The barrel, along
   with everything else, is made in house at Heym in Germany. The action
   features the famous Mauser claw extractor and true controlled feed
   design. A single stage trigger and 4+1 capacity Oberndorf-style
   drop-box magazine is standard. Cartridge options include the .375 H&ampH,
   .416 Rigby, .404 Jeffery, .458 Lott, and .450 Rigby.
   Krieghoff Classic Big Five Double Rifle Krieghoff Classic Big Five
   Double Rifle • Price: $13,995 Krieghoff

   Combining the heritage of traditional side-by-side design and the
   sophistication of modern manufacturing technology, the beautiful
   Krieghoff Classic Double rifle is available in the most common
   chamberings for an African safari or dangerous GAME hunting. It
   features a manual cocking device that allows carrying while fully
   loaded with the hammers uncocked. With options that include additional
   barrels you can more than double the price, as well as your cool
   factor, while sitting on the back of the Land Rover.
   Merkel 470 NE 140-2.1 SXS Merkel 470 NE 140-2.1 SXS • Price: $14,275
   Merkel

   Nothing parts the waters of a hunter’s heart like a finely crafted
   double rifle. The Merkel 470 NE 140-2.1 SXS is elegant, reliable, and
   responsive. It features a steel action, Greener-style cross bolts,
   double triggers, manual safety with intercepting sears, automatic
   ejectors, express sights, and a finely figured wood stock that looks as
   if it has a life of its own.
   Heym Model 88B Double Rifle Heym Model 88B Double Rifle • Price:
   $22,000 Heym

   For more than 35 years, the Heym 88B has been the company’s flagship
   dangerous GAME rifle, and it’s likely the most common double rifle in
   Africa. Handcrafted for a perfect fit and with a host of customizing
   options available, holding this rifle can make your knees feel weak.
   Built with Krupp steel hammer forged barrels and a triple lockup
   boxlock action, automatic ejectors and dual triggers are standard. This
   rifle will even handle the .577 Nitro Express.
   Rigby London Best Rifle Rigby London Best Rifle • Price: $32,000 to
   $72,000 Rigby

   When you can afford the very best of everything in life, a starting
   price of more than $32,000 won’t cause you to blink an eye. What might
   make you order another drink are the options available on the Rigby
   London Best rifle. Grade 11 wood, H&ampH quick detach scope mounts, case
   hardening, engraving, the take-down option, and a custom case later,
   and you’re on the other side of $72,000. But, you might have the finest
   bolt-action rifle in the world. If that doesn’t impress the hippo
   you’re facing, show him the receipt; maybe it will scare him to death.
   Rigby Rising Bite Double Rifle Rigby Rising Bite Double Rifle • Price:
   $136,000 Rigby

   You simply cannot afford this rifle. With its custom fitted Grade 7
   Turkish walnut stock, best sidelock ejector with dipped edge lock
   plates, Rigby ¼ rib and front slight block, and color case hardened
   action, before you start customizing, you’re in for more than a hundred
   grand. A few customizations later you have created what might be the
   most fabulous rifle ever. With a rifle like this, it won’t matter if
   you ever hunt dangerous GAME or not—you can just sit by the fire ring
   and brag about it.
   Holland &amp Holland Royal Double Rifle Holland &amp Holland Royal Double
   Rifle Holland &amp Holland

   Holland &amp Holland’s Royal Double rifle might be the most iconic
   dangerous GAME rifle of all time. Built to deal with any four-legged
   danger while providing the instinctive handling of a finely fitted
   shotgun, these rifles exude luxury, craftsmanship, and history.
   Available in flanged, belted or rimless cartridges, from .284 to .700
   caliber, this is the rifle professional hunters lust for and filthy
   rich safari clients dream of. It will cost more than a trophy wife,
   kill anything that walks, and leave your heirs in a bitter argument
   over who gets it after you depart this Earth. Built to your every
   desire, prices are available by request; which means if you have to
   ask, you don’t have enough money.

   Thinking of party GAME may bring to mind memories of Pin the Tail on
   the Donkey and piñatas, but there are so many more party GAME ideas out
   there that won't make you feel like a kid again. Like road trip GAME,
   clever party GAME can be tailored to the crowd playing them, and these
   ideas are practically guaranteed to make sure everyone has a great
   time.

   If there's no room in your party-planning checklist for GAME time,
   that's fine. (Sometimes, great conversations and catching up with
   distant friends are all a successful gathering needs.) But if you would
   rather fill your holiday party with laughter and activity, or if you
   need to keep little ones entertained, these people-pleasing party GAME
   have you covered.

   Because these GAME have flexible rules and little to no supplies, you
   can keep them casual and make them work for any event, whether it's a
   birthday party, a holiday celebration, or an intimate gathering around
   a small dining table. Most can work for adults or kids, depending on
   what rules you play by. They're all great for families, so you have
   something to do after your gift exchange ideas and GAME or
   Thanksgiving feast besides gathering around the TV.

   Pick a few party GAME that work for you, and keep them in mind for any
   gathering. They're so easy to explain and play that you can whip them
   out at a moment's notice if the party's energy begins to fall, saving
   your celebration from a tired fade-out.
   The Best GAME for Entertaining at Home

Party GAME for any occasion and all ages

   1. Saran Wrap GAME

   This one requires a little prep: You'll need a box of plastic wrap and
   a bag of candy, or an assortment of small, durable goodies. (Packs of
   gum, dollar bills, lottery tickets, and the like all work.) Pick one
   item to place at the center of your saran wrap ball. Wrap it thoroughly
   in plastic wrap, then add more items as your wrapped ball gets bigger,
   trapping them in layers of wrap. (To make the GAME more challenging,
   tear the wrap into smaller sheets as you go.) Once you've used a whole
   roll of wrap (or more, if desired), you're ready to play.

   Gather in a circle or around a table. Give one person the wrapped
   bundle; give the person next to them a pair of dice. The person with
   the saran wrap bundle must unravel as much of the ball as possible
   before the person with the dice rolls doubles. (Any prizes that fall
   out during your turn are yours to keep.) Once the person with the dice
   rolls doubles, they pass the dice down and receive the bundle. Repeat
   until the ball is completely unwound.

   For alternative versions, have the person with the plastic wrap ball
   wear oven mitts, or set a timer for each turn instead of using dice.

   2. Post It Note GAME

   You'll need a stack of sticky notes and a pen. Write a name of a
   well-known public figure or character on each note, then pass them
   around until everyone has one. Without looking, each person should
   stick their note on their forehead or back. Have everyone mingle, or
   sit in a circle and take turns asking yes or no questions to discover
   your assigned identity. ("Am I living?" is a great place to start.)
   Play until everyone has correctly guessed their identity, or pass out
   prizes to those who guess correctly.

   3. How's Yours?

   Pick one person to be "It" and send them from the room. With the people
   remaining, select a common characteristic: hair, articles of clothing,
   or body parts all work. When the person returns, they'll ask someone,
   "How's yours?" That person should then give a one-word adjective to
   describe theirs. (Itchy, thick, and stretchy all work for shirts, for
   example.) Repeat until the person asking guesses the attribute being
   discussed.

   4. Most Likely To

   This party GAME works best for close groups of friends or family
   members. Gather in a circle. Begin with one person asking, "Who's most
   likely to trip over their own feet?" (Or another situation, trait,
   action, etc.) Count down from three (performing a drumroll with your
   hands is encouraged) and then have everyone point at who they think
   would be most likely to do said act. Whoever has the most fingers
   pointed at them is out. Go around the circle asking, "Who's most likely
   to…" until all but one person is out. You can skip the eliminations to
   make the GAME last longer.

   5. Never Have I Ever

   Sit in a circle. Begin with one person saying, "Never have I ever…" and
   finishing with something they have never done. (Traveled to Africa,
   eaten escargot, and the like all work.) If someone has done it, they
   must hold up one finger; if no one in the group has done it, the person
   saying "Never have I ever…" must hold up a finger. Continue around the
   circle until one person has three fingers up: They're out. This party
   GAME can get as racy as you make it, so play carefully and set ground
   rules ahead of time if sensitive grandparents, kids, or conservative
   guests are involved.

   6. Would You Rather?

   Gather in a circle. Ask the person next to you, "Would you rather…" and
   include two challenging situations. ("Would you rather not shower for a
   year or not brush your teeth for a year?" for example.) After their
   response, it's their turn to ask the person next to them. Continue
   until you can't think of any more scenarios.

   7. Heads Up!

   This GAME requires an app: The Heads Up! app is available from the App
   Store and Google Play. After the 99-cent purchase and download, though,
   you have hours of entertainment on-hand at all times. (In-app purchases
   are also available.) One person will hold a phone to their forehead,
   facing out. Everyone else will act out or describe whatever appears on
   the screen while the person with the phone guesses. They have one
   minute to make as many correct guesses as possible, and then the phone
   goes on to the next person. Categories include animals, movies, public
   figures and celebrities, and more.

   8. I'm Hosting a Party…

   For a more cognitive GAME, play this brain teaser. Say you're hosting a
   party, and only people who bring the right contributions are given an
   invitation. Pick a secret rule: Typically, everyone must bring
   something that begins with the same letter as their name, but you can
   also get more creative with it. Don't tell anyone else your rule.

   Go around the room and have each person say what they're bringing; you
   respond to each suggestion with a "Yes, you're invited," or "No, you
   can't bring that." Continue until everyone figures out the rule.

   9. Two Truths and a Lie

   Pick three statements about yourself: "I have two siblings, I've been
   to three continents, and I love cats," for example. Two should be true;
   one should be a lie. Everyone else must guess which is the lie, and
   then the next person goes. This is a great getting-to-know-you GAME; if
   you're playing with family or friends, pick obscure details to trick
   each other to make it even more fun.

   10. Sticker Stalker

   Purchase a pack of stickers. (This one is a great Christmas party GAME
   or Halloween party GAME, so try to find stickers that suit the
   occasion.) Give everyone one sheet of five to 10 stickers (or less,
   depending on the size of the party). This GAME works best at a party
   where everyone is mingling, so you can incorporate it easily into your
   happy hour or neighborhood function. Each person must discreetly place
   all their stickers on other party guests; the first to use all their
   stickers wins. If they get caught stickering someone, they must accept
   a sticker. At the end of the evening, you can laugh about how sneaky
   some people are—and wonder how you ended up with stickers all over your
   back without even noticing.

   11. Mail Call

   Place chairs in a circle, using one less than needed. Have everyone
   take a seat; the one person without a seat must stand in the center of
   the circle. They'll say, "Mail Call for everyone…" and pick a
   descriptor, such as "wearing red" or "has a cat." (There's a lot of
   room for creativity here.) Everyone that descriptor applies to must get
   up and find a new seat without retaking their initial seat or moving to
   the seats next to them. The person in the middle will also be racing
   for a chair; whoever is left standing at the end stands in the circle
   next, and the GAME continues.

   12. Spoons

   Find a deck of cards and a set of spoons. (Pieces of candy also work.)
   Have enough for each player, minus one. Deal four cards to each person
   playing. One person, the dealer, will keep the remaining deck next to
   them and draw one card at a time. They will look at the card and trade
   it out for a card in their hand or pass it along to the person next to
   them, who will do the same thing. The goal is to collect four of the
   same card; when that happens, reach for a spoon. When someone spots a
   spoon missing, they, too, can grab one; whoever is left without a prize
   at the end is out. Remove one more spoon and play again.

   Alternatively, play by sticking out your tongue when you've collected
   four of a kind. If others notice, they can stick out their tongues,
   too; whoever notices last loses.

   13. Camera Hot Potato

   Pick a phone to pass around the group. Set it to self-timer mode—10
   seconds is best—and use regular photo mode, not selfie mode. Pass the
   phone around, with each person holding the phone up for a moment,
   posing for the camera. Pass until the photo is taken, then repeat. At
   the end, take a look at the (probably undignified) photos.

   14. Crossed, Uncrossed

   This is a trickier take on I'm Hosting a Party. Sit in a circle and
   designate yourself as the host. (Just don't tell everyone the name of
   the GAME.) Say you are hosting a party but will only invite people
   bringing the right items. Go around the circle and have everyone
   suggest contributions; the host will say who is invited and who isn't.
   Instead of basing the invite on what they're bringing, though, base it
   on their posture: Whoever has their legs crossed can come, and whoever
   doesn't can't, for example. Continue until everyone figures it out.

   15. In a Perfect World

   Similar to I'm Hosting a Party and Crossed, Uncrossed, have everyone
   sit in a circle. Say you're describing your perfect world: "In my
   perfect world, there are doors but no windows." Have the next person
   describe what might be in your perfect world. Your perfect world has
   only double letter items: schools but not universities, for example, or
   apples but not bananas. If someone gets it right, say, "Yes, that would
   be in my perfect world." If they don't, say so. Continue around the
   circle until everyone figures it out.

   16. Thumper

   Have everyone sit or stand in a circle. Each person should select a
   hand motion (or leg motion, if you're standing). Go around the circle
   and have everyone present their motion. Memorize these. Have everyone
   begin clapping or stomping a steady rhythm and pick one person to
   start: They will do their motion and then the motion of someone else in
   the circle. This next person will do their own motion, then the motion
   of a third person, who will do the same. There are no passbacks and no
   hesitations. Whoever messes up first is out; continue indefinitely.

   17. Straight Face

   Find a pad of paper and writing tools. Have everyone write an
   outrageous phrase on a slip of paper, and collect everything in a hat.
   (If it's a mixed group, set propriety guidelines ahead of time; if it's
   adults-only, go wild.) Gather in a circle. Give one person the hat.
   They must draw a piece of paper and read the statement aloud to the
   group. The goal is to keep a straight face. Whoever laughs or smiles
   loses. Pass the hat around until everything has been read.

   18. Medusa

   Have everyone sit around a table. Everyone will put their heads down;
   count down from three, and have everyone sit up and look at someone
   else in the circle. If you make eye contact with someone else, you're
   out. If the person you're looking at is looking at someone else, you're
   safe. Repeat until everyone is out.

   19. Mr. Freeze

   Pick one person to be Mr. Freeze. Have everyone playing the GAME move
   around the party as usual. When Mr. Freeze freezes, though, everyone
   else must freeze too. Whoever freezes last is out. Repeat for the
   duration of the party.

Oldies but Goodies

   20. Musical Chairs

   Okay, it's a popular party GAME for kids, but adults can also get in on
   the fun. Set up chairs (or seat cushions) in a circle facing outward,
   with enough seating for everyone playing, minus one. Designate one
   person as the music player and have everyone else stand in a circle
   around the circle of seats. When the music starts, walk around the
   seats; everyone must find a seat when the music ends. Whoever doesn't
   is out. Remove one more chair and begin again, until two people are
   fighting for one seat. To make musical chairs more interesting, add
   your own rules. Allow people to sit on top of each other (as long as
   their feet are off the floor), for example, or make your own
   alterations.

   21. Charades

   This tried-and-true party GAME can be as simple or as complicated as
   you make it. Have everyone write down concepts, movies, people, shows,
   and more to act out and divide into teams. One person will act out
   something drawn from the assortment while their team members guess what
   it is. When time is up, switch teams and repeat. Add time limits,
   scoring systems, silence rules, and more as desired.

   22. Telephone

   Gather in a circle. Pick one phrase to whisper in the ear of the person
   next to you—no repeats. That person will whisper what they heard to the
   person next to them, and so on until the phrase gets back to you.
   Prepare to laugh at how distorted it gets. To make it more difficult,
   play music in the background.

   23. 20 Questions

   Pick one person to go first. That person will think of an item, animal,
   movie, public figure, etc. Everyone else will ask yes-or-no questions
   about what or who they are; they have 20 chances to guess, or the other
   person wins. Whoever guesses correctly can win a prize, or be the next
   to answer questions.
   9 Virtual GAME to Play When You Can't Be Together

How to make any party GAME a drinking GAME

   For adults, if you want things to get a little wild, just add alcohol.
   For most GAME, instead of someone being "out" after losing, have them
   take a sip of their drink (or a shot, if you're feeling particularly
   rowdy). In GAME involving rule-making (Kings, Cheers to the Governor,
   etc.), any rule can be turned into an instruction to drink: Women
   drink, men drink, people wearing black drink, etc. If you are
   introducing drinking GAME to your gathering, drink responsibly, and
   stay safe. (And don't forget to offer non-alcoholic mocktail options
   for designated drivers and people who are staying sober.)

Party GAME for adults

   24. Telephone Pictionary

   Tear or cut sheets of paper into pieces, or give each person playing a
   notepad, and pass around pens or pencils. Each person should have as
   many pieces of paper or pages as people playing: If it's a group of 10,
   each person should have 10 pieces of paper, for example.

   Without letting anyone else see, write a word or phrase on the first
   piece of paper. Everyone should pass their stack of papers or notepad
   clockwise. The next person will look at the word or phrase, move it to
   the bottom of the stack, and then draw their interpretation of that
   word or phrase. Once everyone is finished, pass clockwise again. This
   person will look at the picture and interpret it into a word or phrase,
   moving the drawing to the bottom of the stack. Continue passing,
   alternating between drawings and words, until the stacks have gone full
   circle. Flip through the results, and prepare to roar with laughter.

   25. Mafia

   This GAME is also known as Assassin, Werewolf, or Village. If you have
   a large group, a deck of cards, a lot of time, and long attention
   spans, this intense puzzle of a GAME is a lot of fun, if a little
   complicated. See the full rules for Mafia; essentially, certain members
   of the group are the bad guys (the mafia, assassins, etc.); others are
   villagers, and still more are police officers. One is the GAME
   moderator. The police officers are trying to guess who the bad guys are
   before they can kill all the villagers.

   26. Kings

   Shuffle a deck of cards and gather everyone around a table. Place a can
   of beer or soda in the center, and arrange the cards facedown around
   it. Follow the assigned rules for Kings or assign your own rules for
   each card. After drawing a card, slide it under the can's tab before
   performing the card's rule. When the can pops, whoever placed the last
   card must drink it.

Party GAME for kids (and kids at heart)

   27. I Spy

   Pick one person to go first. That person will pick something in the
   room and describe it: "I spy, with my little eye, something green."
   Everyone else will guess what it is, asking only yes or no questions.
   Whoever guesses correctly first can win a prize, or be the next Spyer.

   28. Connection!

   Find a ball of string or yarn. Have everyone stand in a circle. Pick
   one child to go first; give them the yarn and have them begin
   describing their life. When they say something ("I like dogs," for
   example) that someone else in the circle has in common, the second
   child will shout "Connection!" The first child will toss them the yarn,
   and the second child will begin describing their life. Repeat until
   everyone has gone, and the yarn has created a web between all the
   children.

   29. Minute to Win It GAME

   If you've ever seen the old TV GAME show, these are funny physical or
   mental challenges that your party guests have to complete in under a
   minute (great for a lot of laughs). Think picking up Cheerios with a
   toothpick (and their mouths), reciting the alphabet backwards (without
   any mistakes!), sorting a big bowl of M&ampMs or Skittles by color, or
   bouncing ping-pong balls into an egg carton.

   30. Limbo

   This time-honored party GAME lets kids try to see how low they can go.
   (All you need is a broom and some calypso music to make limbo happen!)

   A video GAME^[a] or computer GAME is an electronic GAME that involves
   interaction with a user interface or input device (such as a joystick,
   controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device) to generate visual
   feedback from a display device, most commonly shown in a video format
   on a television set, computer monitor, flat-panel display or
   touchscreen on handheld devices, or a virtual reality headset. Most
   modern video GAME are audiovisual, with audio complement delivered
   through speakers or headphones, and sometimes also with other types of
   sensory feedback (e.g., haptic technology that provides tactile
   sensations), and some video GAME also allow microphone and webcam
   inputs for in-GAME chatting and livestreaming.

   Video GAME are typically categorized according to their hardware
   platform, which traditionally includes arcade video GAME, console
   GAME, and computer (PC) GAME; the latter also encompasses LAN GAME,
   online GAME, and browser GAME. More recently, the video GAME industry
   has expanded onto mobile gaming through mobile devices (such as
   smartphones and tablet computers), virtual and augmented reality
   systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video GAME are also classified into
   a wide range of genres based on their style of gameplay and target
   audience.

   The first video GAME prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s were simple
   extensions of electronic GAME using video-like output from large,
   room-sized mainframe computers. The first consumer video GAME was the
   arcade video GAME Computer Space in 1971. In 1972 came the iconic hit
   GAME Pong and the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. The
   industry grew quickly during the "golden age" of arcade video GAME
   from the late 1970s to early 1980s but suffered from the crash of the
   North American video GAME market in 1983 due to loss of publishing
   control and saturation of the market. Following the crash, the industry
   matured, was dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, Sega,
   and Sony, and established practices and methods around the development
   and distribution of video GAME to prevent a similar crash in the
   future, many of which continue to be followed. In the 2000s, the core
   industry centered on "AAA" GAME, leaving little room for riskier
   experimental GAME. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and
   digital distribution, this gave room for independent video GAME
   development (or "indie GAME") to gain prominence into the 2010s. Since
   then, the commercial importance of the video GAME industry has been
   increasing. The emerging Asian markets and proliferation of smartphone
   GAME in particular are altering player demographics towards casual
   gaming and increasing monetization by incorporating GAME as a service.

   Today, video GAME development requires numerous interdisciplinary
   skills, vision, teamwork, and liaisons between different parties,
   including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, hardware
   manufacturers, and other marketers, to successfully bring a GAME to its
   consumers. As of 2020^[update], the global video GAME market had
   estimated annual revenues of US$159 billion across hardware, software,
   and services, which is three times the size of the global music
   industry and four times that of the film industry in 2019,^[1] making
   it a formidable heavyweight across the modern entertainment industry.
   The video GAME market is also a major influence behind the electronics
   industry, where personal computer component, console, and peripheral
   sales, as well as consumer demands for better GAME performance, have
   been powerful driving factors for hardware design and innovation.

   Tennis for Two (1958), an early analog computer GAME that used an
   oscilloscope for a display

   Early video GAME use interactive electronic devices with various
   display formats. The earliest example is from 1947—a "cathode-ray tube
   amusement device" was filed for a patent on 25 January 1947, by Thomas
   T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann, and issued on 14 December 1948, as
   U.S. Patent 2455992.^[2] Inspired by radar display technology, it
   consists of an analog device allowing a user to control the parabolic
   arc of a dot on the screen to simulate a missile being fired at
   targets, which are paper drawings fixed to the screen.^[3] Other early
   examples include Christopher Strachey's draughts GAME, the Nimrod
   computer at the 1951 Festival of Britain; OXO, a tic-tac-toe computer
   GAME by Alexander S. Douglas for the EDSAC in 1952; Tennis for Two, an
   electronic interactive GAME engineered by William Higinbotham in 1958;
   and Spacewar!, written by Massachusetts Institute of Technology
   students Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen's on a DEC
   PDP-1 computer in 1961. Each GAME has different means of display:
   NIMROD has a panel of lights to play the GAME of Nim,^[4] OXO has a
   graphical display to play tic-tac-toe,^[5] Tennis for Two has an
   oscilloscope to display a side view of a tennis court,^[3] and
   Spacewar! has the DEC PDP-1's vector display to have two spaceships
   battle each other.^[6]

   These preliminary inventions paved the way for the origins of video
   GAME today. Ralph H. Baer, while working at Sanders Associates in
   1966, devised a control system to play a rudimentary GAME of table
   tennis on a television screen. With the company's approval, Baer built
   the prototype "Brown Box". Sanders patented Baer's inventions and
   licensed them to Magnavox, which commercialized it as the first home
   video GAME console, the Magnavox Odyssey, released in 1972.^[3]^[7]
   Separately, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, inspired by seeing Spacewar!
   running at Stanford University, devised a similar version running in a
   smaller coin-operated arcade cabinet using a less expensive computer.
   This was released as Computer Space, the first arcade video GAME, in
   1971.^[8] Bushnell and Dabney went on to form Atari, Inc., and with
   Allan Alcorn, created their second arcade GAME in 1972, the hit ping
   pong-style Pong, which was directly inspired by the table tennis GAME
   on the Odyssey. Sanders and Magnavox sued Atari for infringement of
   Baer's patents, but Atari settled out of court, paying for perpetual
   rights to the patents. Following their agreement, Atari made a home
   version of Pong, which was released by Christmas 1975.^[3] The success
   of the Odyssey and Pong, both as an arcade GAME and home machine,
   launched the video GAME industry.^[9]^[10] Both Baer and Bushnell have
   been titled "Father of Video GAME" for their contributions.^[11]^[12]

Terminology

   The term "video GAME" was developed to distinguish this class of
   electronic GAME that were played on some type of video display rather
   than on a teletype printer, audio speaker or similar device.^[13] This
   also distinguished from many handheld electronic GAME like Merlin
   which commonly used LED lights for indicators but did not use these in
   combination for imaging purposes.^[14]

   "Computer GAME" may also be used as a descriptor, as all these types of
   GAME essentially require the use of a computer processor, and in some
   cases, it is used interchangeably with "video GAME".^[15] Particularly
   in the United Kingdom and Western Europe, this is common due to the
   historic relevance of domestically produced microcomputers. Other terms
   used include digital GAME, for example by the Australian Bureau of
   Statistics.^[16] However, the term "computer GAME" can also be used to
   more specifically refer to GAME played primarily on personal computers
   or other type of flexible hardware systems (also known as a PC GAME),
   as a way distinguish them from console GAME, arcade GAME or mobile
   GAME.^[14]^[13] Other terms such as "television GAME" or "teleGAME"
   had been used in the 1970s and early 1980s, particularly for the home
   gaming consoles that rely on connection to a television set.^[17] In
   Japan, where consoles like the Odyssey were first imported and then
   made within the country by the large television manufacturers such as
   Toshiba and Sharp Corporation, such GAME are known as "TV GAME", or
   TV geemu or terebi geemu.^[18] "Electronic GAME" may also be used to
   refer to video GAME, but this also incorporates devices like early
   handheld electronic GAME that lack any video output.^[15] and the term
   "TV GAME" is still commonly used into the 21st century.^[18]^[19]

   The first appearance of the term "video GAME" emerged around 1973. The
   Oxford English Dictionary cited a 10 November 1973 BusinessWeek article
   as the first printed use of the term.^[20] Though Bushnell believed the
   term came from a vending magazine review of Computer Space in
   1971,^[21] a review of the major vending magazines Vending Times and
   Cashbox showed that the term came much earlier, appearing first around
   March 1973 in these magazines in mass usage including by the arcade
   GAME manufacturers. As analyzed by video GAME historian Keith Smith,
   the sudden appearance suggested that the term had been proposed and
   readily adopted by those involved. This appeared to trace to Ed Adlum,
   who ran Cashbox's coin-operated section until 1972 and then later
   founded RePlay Magazine, covering the coin-op amusement field, in 1975.
   In a September 1982 issue of RePlay, Adlum is credited with first
   naming these GAME as "video GAME": "RePlay's Eddie Adlum worked at
   'Cash Box' when 'TV GAME' first came out. The personalities in those
   days were Bushnell, his sales manager Pat Karns and a handful of other
   'TV GAME' manufacturers like Henry Leyser and the McEwan brothers. It
   seemed awkward to call their products 'TV GAME', so borrowing a word
   from Billboard's description of movie jukeboxes, Adlum started to refer
   to this new breed of amusement machine as 'video GAME.' The phrase
   stuck."^[citation needed] Adlum explained in 1985 that up until the
   early 1970s, amusement arcades typically had non-video arcade GAME
   such as pinball machines and electro-mechanical GAME. With the arrival
   of video GAME in arcades during the early 1970s, there was initially
   some confusion in the arcade industry over what term should be used to
   describe the new GAME. He "wrestled with descriptions of this type of
   GAME," alternating between "TV GAME" and "television GAME" but "finally
   woke up one day" and said, "what the hell... video GAME!"^[22]

   For many years, the traveling Videotopia exhibit served as the closest
   representation of such a vital resource. In addition to collecting home
   video GAME consoles, the Electronics Conservancy organization set out
   to locate and restore 400 antique arcade cabinets after realizing that
   the majority of these GAME had been destroyed and feared the loss of
   their historical significance.^[23] Video GAME have significantly
   began to be seen in the real-world as a purpose to present history in a
   way of understanding the methodology and terms that are being compared.
   Researchers have looked at how historical representations affect how
   the public perceives the past, and digital humanists encourage
   historians to use video GAME as primary materials.^[24] Video GAME,
   considering their past and age, have over time progressed as what a
   video GAME really means. Whether played through a monitor, TV, or a
   hand-held device, there are many ways that video GAME are being
   displayed for users to enjoy. People have drawn comparisons between
   flow-state-engaged video gamers and pupils in conventional school
   settings. In traditional, teacher-led classrooms, students have little
   say in what they learn, are passive consumers of the information
   selected by teachers, are required to follow the pace and skill level
   of the group (group teaching), and receive brief, imprecise, normative
   feedback on their work.^[25] Video GAME, as they continue to develop
   into better graphic definition and genre's, create new terminology when
   something unknown tends to become known. Yearly, consoles are being
   created to compete against other brands with similar functioning
   features that tends to lead the consumer into which they'd like to
   purchase. Now, companies have moved towards GAME only the specific
   console can play to grasp the consumer into purchasing their product
   compared to when video GAME first began, there was little to no
   variety. In 1989, a console war begun with Nintendo, one of the biggest
   in gaming was up against target, Sega with their brand new Master
   System which, failed to compete, allowing the Nintendo Emulator System
   to be one of the most consumed product in the world.^[26] More
   technology continued to be created, as the computer began to be used in
   people's houses for more than just office and daily use. GAME began
   being implemented into computers and have progressively grown since
   then with coded robots to play against you. Early GAME like
   tic-tac-toe, solitaire, and Tennis for Two were great ways to bring new
   gaming to another system rather than one specifically meant for
   gaming.^[27]

  Definition

   While many GAME readily fall into a clear, well-understood definition
   of video GAME, new genres and innovations in GAME development have
   raised the question of what are the essential factors of a video GAME
   that separate the medium from other forms of entertainment.

   The introduction of interactive films in the 1980s with GAME like
   Dragon's Lair, featured GAME with full motion video played off a form
   of media but only limited user interaction.^[28] This had required a
   means to distinguish these GAME from more traditional board GAME that
   happen to also use external media, such as the Clue VCR Mystery GAME
   which required players to watch VCR clips between turns. To distinguish
   between these two, video GAME are considered to require some
   interactivity that affects the visual display.^[14]

   Most video GAME tend to feature some type of victory or winning
   conditions, such as a scoring mechanism or a final boss fight. The
   introduction of walking simulators (adventure GAME that allow for
   exploration but lack any objectives) like Gone Home, and empathy GAME
   (video GAME that tend to focus on emotion) like That Dragon, Cancer
   brought the idea of GAME that did not have any such type of winning
   condition and raising the question of whether these were actually
   GAME.^[29] These are still commonly justified as video GAME as they
   provide a GAME world that the player can interact with by some
   means.^[30]

   The lack of any industry definition for a video GAME by 2021 was an
   issue during the case Epic GAME v. Apple which dealt with video GAME
   offered on Apple's iOS App Store. Among concerns raised were GAME like
   Fortnite Creative and Roblox which created metaverses of interactive
   experiences, and whether the larger GAME and the individual experiences
   themselves were GAME or not in relation to fees that Apple charged for
   the App Store. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, recognizing that there was
   yet an industry standard definition for a video GAME, established for
   her ruling that "At a bare minimum, videoGAME appear to require some
   level of interactivity or involvement between the player and the
   medium" compared to passive entertainment like film, music, and
   television, and "videoGAME are also generally graphically rendered or
   animated, as opposed to being recorded live or via motion capture as in
   films or television".^[31] Rogers still concluded that what is a video
   GAME "appears highly eclectic and diverse".^[31]

   [220px-Freedoom002_01.png] Freedoom, a clone of the first-person
   shooter Doom. Common elements include a heads-up display along the
   bottom that includes the player's remaining health and ammunition.

   The gameplay experience varies radically between video GAME, but many
   common elements exist. Most GAME will launch into a title screen and
   give the player a chance to review options such as the number of
   players before starting a GAME. Most GAME are divided into levels
   which the player must work the avatar through, scoring points,
   collecting power-ups to boost the avatar's innate attributes, all while
   either using special attacks to defeat enemies or moves to avoid them.
   This information is relayed to the player through a type of on-screen
   user interface such as a heads-up display atop the rendering of the
   GAME itself. Taking damage will deplete their avatar's health, and if
   that falls to zero or if the avatar otherwise falls into an
   impossible-to-escape location, the player will lose one of their lives.
   Should they lose all their lives without gaining an extra life or
   "1-UP", then the player will reach the "GAME over" screen. Many levels
   as well as the GAME's finale end with a type of boss character the
   player must defeat to continue on. In some GAME, intermediate points
   between levels will offer save points where the player can create a
   saved GAME on storage media to restart the GAME should they lose all
   their lives or need to stop the GAME and restart at a later time. These
   also may be in the form of a passage that can be written down and
   reentered at the title screen.^[citation needed]

   Product flaws include software bugs which can manifest as glitches
   which may be exploited by the player; this is often the foundation of
   speedrunning a video GAME. These bugs, along with cheat codes, Easter
   eggs, and other hidden secrets that were intentionally added to the
   GAME can also be exploited.^[32]^[33]^[34]^[35] On some consoles, cheat
   cartridges allow players to execute these cheat codes, and
   user-developed trainers allow similar bypassing for computer software
   GAME. Both of which might make the GAME easier, give the player
   additional power-ups, or change the appearance of the GAME.^[33]

   To distinguish from electronic GAME, a video GAME is generally
   considered to require a platform, the hardware which contains computing
   elements, to process player interaction from some type of input device
   and displays the results to a video output display.^[36]

   Video GAME require a platform, a specific combination of electronic
   components or computer hardware and associated software, to
   operate.^[37] The term system is also commonly used. GAME are
   typically designed to be played on one or a limited number of
   platforms, and exclusivity to a platform is used as a competitive edge
   in the video GAME market.^[38] However, GAME may be developed for
   alternative platforms than intended, which are described as ports or
   conversions. These also may be remasters - where most of the original
   GAME's source code is reused and art assets, models, and GAME levels
   are updated for modern systems – and remakes, where in addition to
   asset improvements, significant reworking of the original GAME and
   possibly from scratch is performed.^[39]

   The list below is not exhaustive and excludes other electronic devices
   capable of playing video GAME such as PDAs and graphing calculators.

   PC GAME
          PC GAME involve a player interacting with a personal computer
          (PC) connected to a video monitor.^[40] Personal computers are
          not dedicated GAME platforms, so there may be differences
          running the same GAME on different hardware. Also, the openness
          allows some features to developers like reduced software
          cost,^[41] increased flexibility, increased innovation,
          emulation, creation of modifications or mods, open hosting for
          online gaming (in which a person plays a video GAME with people
          who are in a different household) and others. A gaming computer
          is a PC or laptop intended specifically for gaming, typically
          using high-performance, high-cost components. In additional to
          personal computer gaming, there also exist GAME that work on
          mainframe computers and other similarly shared systems, with
          users logging in remotely to use the computer.

   Home console
          [220px-PS2-Fat-Console-Set.jpg] The PlayStation 2 is the
          best-selling video GAME console, with over 155 million units
          sold.^[42]A console GAME is played on a home console, a
          specialized electronic device that connects to a common
          television set or composite video monitor. Home consoles are
          specifically designed to play GAME using a dedicated hardware
          environment, giving developers a concrete hardware target for
          development and assurances of what features will be available,
          simplifying development compared to PC GAME development. Usually
          consoles only run GAME developed for it, or GAME from other
          platform made by the same company, but never GAME developed by
          its direct competitor, even if the same GAME is available on
          different platforms. It often comes with a specific GAME
          controller. Major console platforms include Xbox, PlayStation
          and Nintendo.

   Handheld console
          A handheld GAME console is a small, self-contained electronic
          device that is portable and can be held in a user's hands. It
          features the console, a small screen, speakers and buttons,
          joystick or other GAME controllers in a single unit. Like
          consoles, handhelds are dedicated platforms, and share almost
          the same characteristics. Handheld hardware usually is less
          powerful than PC or console hardware. Some handheld GAME from
          the late 1970s and early 1980s could only play one GAME. In the
          1990s and 2000s, a number of handheld GAME used cartridges,
          which enabled them to be used to play many different GAME. The
          handheld console has waned in the 2010s as mobile device gaming
          has become a more dominant factor.

   Arcade video GAME
          [220px-Light_gun_survival_horror_arcade_GAME.jpg] A
          police-themed arcade GAME in which players use a light gun An
          arcade video GAME generally refers to a GAME played on an even
          more specialized type of electronic device that is typically
          designed to play only one GAME and is encased in a special,
          large coin-operated cabinet which has one built-in console,
          controllers (joystick, buttons, etc.), a CRT screen, and audio
          amplifier and speakers. Arcade GAME often have brightly painted
          logos and images relating to the theme of the GAME. While most
          arcade GAME are housed in a vertical cabinet, which the user
          typically stands in front of to play, some arcade GAME use a
          tabletop approach, in which the display screen is housed in a
          table-style cabinet with a see-through table top. With table-top
          GAME, the users typically sit to play. In the 1990s and 2000s,
          some arcade GAME offered players a choice of multiple GAME. In
          the 1980s, video arcades were businesses in which GAME players
          could use a number of arcade video GAME. In the 2010s, there
          are far fewer video arcades, but some movie theaters and family
          entertainment centers still have them.

   Browser GAME
          A browser GAME takes advantages of standardizations of
          technologies for the functionality of web browsers across
          multiple devices providing a cross-platform environment. These
          GAME may be identified based on the website that they appear,
          such as with Miniclip GAME. Others are named based on the
          programming platform used to develop them, such as Java and
          Flash GAME.

   Mobile GAME
          With the introduction of smartphones and tablet computers
          standardized on the iOS and Android operating systems, mobile
          gaming has become a significant platform. These GAME may use
          unique features of mobile devices that are not necessary present
          on other platforms, such as accelerometers, global positing
          information and camera devices to support augmented reality
          gameplay.

   Cloud gaming
          Cloud gaming requires a minimal hardware device, such as a basic
          computer, console, laptop, mobile phone or even a dedicated
          hardware device connected to a display with good Internet
          connectivity that connects to hardware systems by the cloud
          gaming provider. The GAME is computed and rendered on the remote
          hardware, using a number of predictive methods to reduce the
          network latency between player input and output on their display
          device. For example, the Xbox Cloud Gaming and PlayStation Now
          platforms use dedicated custom server blade hardware in cloud
          computing centers.

   Virtual reality
          [220px-GAMEcom_Playstation_VR_Playseat_%2836454815300%29.jpg]
          Players using the PlayStation VR headsets in 2017 Virtual
          reality (VR) GAME generally require players to use a special
          head-mounted unit that provides stereoscopic screens and motion
          tracking to immerse a player within virtual environment that
          responds to their head movements. Some VR systems include
          control units for the player's hands as to provide a direct way
          to interact with the virtual world. VR systems generally require
          a separate computer, console, or other processing device that
          couples with the head-mounted unit.

   Emulation
          An emulator enables GAME from a console or otherwise different
          system to be run in a type of virtual machine on a modern
          system, simulating the hardware of the original and allows old
          GAME to be played. While emulators themselves have been found
          to be legal in United States case law, the act of obtaining the
          GAME software that one does not already own may violate
          copyrights. However, there are some official releases of
          emulated software from GAME manufacturers, such as Nintendo with
          its Virtual Console or Nintendo Switch Online offerings.

   Backward compatibility
          Backward compatibility is similar in nature to emulation in that
          older GAME can be played on newer platforms, but typically
          directly though hardware and build-in software within the
          platform. For example, the PlayStation 2 is capable of playing
          original PlayStation GAME simply by inserting the original GAME
          media into the newer console, while Nintendo's Wii could play
          GameCube titles as well in the same manner.

  GAME media

   [220px-NES-Cartridge.jpg] An unlabeled GAME cartridge for the Nintendo
   Entertainment System

   Early arcade GAME, home consoles, and handheld GAME were dedicated
   hardware units with the GAME's logic built into the electronic
   componentry of the hardware. Since then, most video GAME platforms are
   considered programmable, having means to read and play multiple GAME
   distributed on different types of media or formats. Physical formats
   include ROM cartridges, magnetic storage including magnetic-tape data
   storage and floppy discs, optical media formats including CD-ROM and
   DVDs, and flash memory cards. Furthermore digital distribution over the
   Internet or other communication methods as well as cloud gaming
   alleviate the need for any physical media. In some cases, the media
   serves as the direct read-only memory for the GAME, or it may be the
   form of installation media that is used to write the main assets to the
   player's platform's local storage for faster loading periods and later
   updates.

   GAME can be extended with new content and software patches through
   either expansion packs which are typically available as physical media,
   or as downloadable content nominally available via digital
   distribution. These can be offered freely or can be used to monetize a
   GAME following its initial release. Several GAME offer players the
   ability to create user-generated content to share with others to play.
   Other GAME, mostly those on personal computers, can be extended with
   user-created modifications or mods that alter or add onto the GAME;
   these often are unofficial and were developed by players from reverse
   engineering of the GAME, but other GAME provide official support for
   modding the GAME.^[43]

  Input device

   Main article: GAME controller

   [220px-Nintendo-Super-NES-Controller.jpg] A North American Super NES
   GAME controller from the early 1990s

   Video GAME can use several types of input devices to translate human
   actions to a GAME. Most common are the use of GAME controllers like
   gamepads and joysticks for most consoles, and as accessories for
   personal computer systems along keyboard and mouse controls. Common
   controls on the most recent controllers include face buttons, shoulder
   triggers, analog sticks, and directional pads ("d-pads"). Consoles
   typically include standard controllers which are shipped or bundled
   with the console itself, while peripheral controllers are available as
   a separate purchase from the console manufacturer or third-party
   vendors.^[44] Similar control sets are built into handheld consoles and
   onto arcade cabinets. Newer technology improvements have incorporated
   additional technology into the controller or the GAME platform, such as
   touchscreens and motion detection sensors that give more options for
   how the player interacts with the GAME. Specialized controllers may be
   used for certain genres of GAME, including racing wheels, light guns
   and dance pads. Digital cameras and motion detection can capture
   movements of the player as input into the GAME, which can, in some
   cases, effectively eliminate the control, and on other systems such as
   virtual reality, are used to enhance immersion into the GAME.

  Display and output

   Main article: Video GAME graphics

   [170px-GAME-Boy-FL.jpg] Handheld units, like the GAME Boy, include
   built-in output screens and sound speakers.

   By definition, all video GAME are intended to output graphics to an
   external video display, such as cathode-ray tube televisions, newer
   liquid-crystal display (LCD) televisions and built-in screens,
   projectors or computer monitors, depending on the type of platform the
   GAME is played on. Features such as color depth, refresh rate, frame
   rate, and screen resolution are a combination of the limitations of the
   GAME platform and display device and the program efficiency of the GAME
   itself. The GAME's output can range from fixed displays using LED or
   LCD elements, text-based GAME, two-dimensional and three-dimensional
   graphics, and augmented reality displays.

   The GAME's graphics are often accompanied by sound produced by internal
   speakers on the GAME platform or external speakers attached to the
   platform, as directed by the GAME's programming. This often will
   include sound effects tied to the player's actions to provide audio
   feedback, as well as background music for the GAME.

   Some platforms support additional feedback mechanics to the player that
   a GAME can take advantage of. This is most commonly haptic technology
   built into the GAME controller, such as causing the controller to shake
   in the player's hands to simulate a shaking earthquake occurring in
   GAME.

Classifications

   Video GAME are frequently classified by a number of factors related to
   how one plays them.

  Genre

   Main article: Video GAME genre

   See also: Gameplay

   Dustforce is representative of the platform GAME genre as its gameplay
   involves jumping between platforms.

   A video GAME, like most other forms of media, may be categorized into
   genres. However, unlike film or television which use visual or
   narrative elements, video GAME are generally categorized into genres
   based on their gameplay interaction, since this is the primary means
   which one interacts with a video GAME.^[45]^[46]^[47] The narrative
   setting does not impact gameplay; a shooter GAME is still a shooter
   GAME, regardless of whether it takes place in a fantasy world or in
   outer space.^[48]^[49] An exception is the horror GAME genre, used for
   GAME that are based on narrative elements of horror fiction, the
   supernatural, and psychological horror.^[50]

   Genre names are normally self-describing in terms of the type of
   gameplay, such as action GAME, role playing GAME, or shoot 'em up,
   though some genres have derivations from influential works that have
   defined that genre, such as roguelikes from Rogue,^[51] Grand Theft
   Auto clones from Grand Theft Auto III,^[52] and battle royale GAME
   from the film Battle Royale.^[53] The names may shift over time as
   players, developers and the media come up with new terms; for example,
   first-person shooters were originally called "Doom clones" based on the
   1993 GAME.^[54] A hierarchy of GAME genres exist, with top-level genres
   like "shooter GAME" and "action GAME" that broadly capture the GAME's
   main gameplay style, and several subgenres of specific implementation,
   such as within the shooter GAME first-person shooter and third-person
   shooter. Some cross-genre types also exist that fall until multiple
   top-level genres such as action-adventure GAME.

  Mode

   [220px-Winter_2004_DreamHack_LAN_Party.jpg] A LAN party at the 2004
   DreamHack with hundreds of players

   A video GAME's mode describes how many players can use the GAME at the
   same type. This is primarily distinguished by single-player video GAME
   and multiplayer video GAME. Within the latter category, multiplayer
   GAME can be played in a variety of ways, including locally at the same
   device, on separate devices connected through a local network such as
   LAN parties, or online via separate Internet connections. Most
   multiplayer GAME are based on competitive gameplay, but many offer
   cooperative and team-based options as well as asymmetric gameplay.
   Online GAME use server structures that can also enable massively
   multiplayer online GAME (MMOs) to support hundreds of players at the
   same time.

   A small number of video GAME are zero-player GAME, in which the
   player has very limited interaction with the GAME itself. These are
   most commonly simulation GAME where the player may establish a
   starting state and then let the GAME proceed on its own, watching the
   results as a passive observer, such as with many computerized
   simulations of Conway's GAME of Life.^[55]

  Types

   Most video GAME are intended for entertainment purposes.^[36]
   Different GAME types include:

   Core GAME
          Core or hard-core GAME refer to the typical perception of video
          GAME, developed for entertainment purposes. These GAME
          typically require a fair amount of time to learn and master, in
          contrast to casual GAME, and thus are most appealing to gamers
          rather than a broader audience. Most of the AAA video GAME
          industry is based around the delivery of core GAME.^[56]

   Casual GAME
          In contrast to core GAME, casual GAME are designed for ease of
          accessibility, simple to understand gameplay and quick to grasp
          rule sets, and aimed at mass market audience. They frequently
          support the ability to jump in and out of play on demand, such
          as during commuting or lunch breaks. Numerous browser and mobile
          GAME fall into the casual GAME area, and casual GAME often are
          from genres with low intensity GAME elements such as match
          three, hidden object, time management, and puzzle GAME.^[57]
          Causal GAME frequently use social-network GAME mechanics, where
          players can enlist the help of friends on their social media
          networks for extra turns or moves each day.^[58] Popular casual
          GAME include Tetris and Candy Crush Saga. More recent, starting
          in the late 2010s, are hyper-casual GAME which use even more
          simplistic rules for short but infinitely replayable GAME, such
          as Flappy Bird.^[59]

   Educational GAME
          Education software has been used in homes and classrooms to help
          teach children and students, and video GAME have been similarly
          adapted for these reasons, all designed to provide a form of
          interactivity and entertainment tied to GAME design elements.
          There are a variety of differences in their designs and how they
          educate the user. These are broadly split between edutainment
          GAME that tend to focus on the entertainment value and rote
          learning but are unlikely to engage in critical thinking, and
          educational video GAME that are geared towards problem solving
          through motivation and positive reinforcement while downplaying
          the entertainment value.^[60] Examples of educational GAME
          include The Oregon Trail and the Carmen Sandiego series.
          Further, GAME not initially developed for educational purposes
          have found their way into the classroom after release, such as
          that feature open worlds or virtual sandboxes like
          Minecraft,^[61] or offer critical thinking skills through puzzle
          video GAME like SpaceChem.^[62]

   Serious GAME
          [220px-AFA_Beech_in_Flight_Simulator.jpg] Microsoft Flight
          Simulator is an example of a simulation GAME. Further extending
          from educational GAME, serious GAME are those where the
          entertainment factor may be augmented, overshadowed, or even
          eliminated by other purposes for the GAME. GAME design is used
          to reinforce the non-entertainment purpose of the GAME, such as
          using video GAME technology for the GAME's interactive world, or
          gamification for reinforcement training. Educational GAME are a
          form of serious GAME, but other types of GAME include fitness
          GAME that incorporate significant physical exercise to help
          keep the player fit (such as Wii Fit), simulator GAME that
          resemble fight simulators to pilot aircraft (such as Microsoft
          Flight Simulator), adverGAME that are built around the
          advertising of a product (such as Pepsiman), and newsGAME aimed
          at conveying a specific advocacy message (such as
          NarcoGuerra).^[63]^[64]

   Art GAME
          Although video GAME have been considered an art form on their
          own, GAME may be developed to try to purposely communicate a
          story or message, using the medium as a work of art. These art
          or arthouse GAME are designed to generate emotion and empathy
          from the player by challenging societal norms and offering
          critique through the interactivity of the video GAME medium.
          They may not have any type of win condition and are designed to
          let the player explore through the GAME world and scenarios.
          Most art GAME are indie GAME in nature, designed based on
          personal experiences or stories through a single developer or
          small team. Examples of art GAME include Passage, Flower, and
          That Dragon, Cancer.^[65]^[66]^[67]

  Content rating

   Main article: Video GAME content rating system

   [ESRBrating.PNG] A typical ESRB rating label, listing the rating and
   specific content descriptors for Rabbids Go Home

   Video GAME can be subject to national and international content rating
   requirements. Like with film content ratings, video GAME ratings typing
   identify the target age group that the national or regional ratings
   board believes is appropriate for the player, ranging from all-ages, to
   a teenager-or-older, to mature, to the infrequent adult-only GAME.
   Most content review is based on the level of violence, both in the type
   of violence and how graphic it may be represented, and sexual content,
   but other themes such as drug and alcohol use and gambling that can
   influence children may also be identified. A primary identifier based
   on a minimum age is used by nearly all systems, along with additional
   descriptors to identify specific content that players and parents
   should be aware of.

   The regulations vary from country to country but generally are
   voluntary systems upheld by vendor practices, with penalty and fines
   issued by the ratings body on the video GAME publisher for misuse of
   the ratings. Among the major content rating systems include:
     * Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) that oversees GAME
       released in the United States. ESRB ratings are voluntary and rated
       along a E (Everyone), E10+ (Everyone 10 and older), T (Teen), M
       (Mature), and AO (Adults Only). Attempts to mandate video GAME
       ratings in the U.S. subsequently led to the landmark Supreme Court
       case, Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association in 2011 which
       ruled video GAME were a protected form of art, a key victory for
       the video GAME industry.^[68]
     * Pan European GAME Information (PEGI) covering the United Kingdom,
       most of the European Union and other European countries, replacing
       previous national-based systems. The PEGI system uses content rated
       based on minimum recommended ages, which include 3+, 8+, 12+, 16+,
       and 18+.
     * Australian Classification Board (ACB) oversees the ratings of GAME
       and other works in Australia, using ratings of G (General), PG
       (Parental Guidance), M (Mature), MA15+ (Mature Accompanied), R18+
       (Restricted), and X (Restricted for pornographic material). ACB can
       also deny to give a rating to GAME (RC – Refused Classification).
       The ACB's ratings are enforceable by law, and importantly, GAME
       cannot be imported or purchased digitally in Australia if they have
       failed to gain a rating or were given the RC rating, leading to a
       number of notable banned GAME.
     * Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO) rates GAME for
       Japan. Their ratings include A (all ages), B (12 and older), C (15
       and over), D (17 and over), and Z (18 and over).

   Additionally, the major content system provides have worked to create
   the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC), a means to streamline
   and align the content ratings system between different region, so that
   a publisher would only need to complete the content ratings review for
   one provider, and use the IARC transition to affirm the content rating
   for all other regions.

   Certain nations have even more restrictive rules related to political
   or ideological content. Within Germany, until 2018, the
   Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle (Entertainment Software
   Self-Regulation) would refuse to classify, and thus allow sale, of any
   GAME depicting Nazi imagery, and thus often requiring developers to
   replace such imagery with fictional ones. This ruling was relaxed in
   2018 to allow for such imagery for "social adequacy" purposes that
   applied to other works of art.^[69] China's video GAME segment is
   mostly isolated from the rest of the world due to the government's
   censorship, and all GAME published there must adhere to strict
   government review, disallowing content such as smearing the image of
   the Chinese Communist Party. Foreign GAME published in China often
   require modification by developers and publishers to meet these
   requirements.^[70]

   entertainment, is frequently a cross-disciplinary field. Video GAME
   developers, as employees within this industry are commonly referred,
   primarily include programmers and graphic designers. Over the years
   this has expanded to include almost every type of skill that one might
   see prevalent in the creation of any movie or television program,
   including sound designers, musicians, and other technicians; as well as
   skills that are specific to video GAME, such as the GAME designer. All
   of these are managed by producers.

   In the early days of the industry, it was more common for a single
   person to manage all of the roles needed to create a video GAME. As
   platforms have become more complex and powerful in the type of material
   they can present, larger teams have been needed to generate all of the
   art, programming, cinematography, and more. This is not to say that the
   age of the "one-man shop" is gone, as this is still sometimes found in
   the casual gaming and handheld markets,^[71] where smaller GAME are
   prevalent due to technical limitations such as limited RAM or lack of
   dedicated 3D graphics rendering capabilities on the target platform
   (e.g., some PDAs).^[72]

   Video GAME are programmed like any other piece of computer software.
   Prior to the mid-1970s, arcade and home consoles were programmed by
   assembling discrete electro-mechanical components on circuit boards,
   which limited GAME to relatively simple logic. By 1975, low-cost
   microprocessors were available at volume to be used for video GAME
   hardware, which allowed GAME developers to program more detailed GAME,
   widening the scope of what was possible.^[73]^[74] Ongoing improvements
   in computer hardware technology has expanded what has become possible
   to create in video GAME, coupled with convergence of common hardware
   between console, computer, and arcade platforms to simplify the
   development process.^[75] Today, GAME developers have a number of
   commercial and open source tools available for use to make GAME, often
   which are across multiple platforms to support portability, or may
   still opt to create their own for more specialized features and direct
   control of the GAME. Today, many GAME are built around a GAME engine
   that handles the bulk of the GAME's logic, gameplay, and rendering.
   These engines can be augmented with specialized engines for specific
   features, such as a physics engine that simulates the physics of
   objects in real-time. A variety of middleware exists to help developers
   to access other features, such as for playback of videos within GAME,
   network-oriented code for GAME that communicate via online services,
   matchmaking for online GAME, and similar features. These features can
   be used from a developers' programming language of choice, or they may
   opt to also use GAME development kits that minimize the amount of
   direct programming they have to do but can also limit the amount of
   customization they can add into a GAME. Like all software, video GAME
   usually undergo quality testing before release to assure there are no
   bugs or glitches in the product, though frequently developers will
   release patches and updates.

   With the growth of the size of development teams in the industry, the
   problem of cost has increased. Development studios need the best
   talent, while publishers reduce costs to maintain profitability on
   their investment. Typically, a video GAME console development team
   ranges from 5 to 50 people, and some exceed 100. In May 2009,
   Assassin's Creed II was reported to have a development staff of
   450.^[76] The growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get
   completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs
   has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines, rushed GAME and
   the release of unfinished products.^[77]

   While amateur and hobbyist GAME programming had existed since the late
   1970s with the introduction of home computers, a newer trend since the
   mid-2000s is indie GAME development. Indie GAME are made by small
   teams outside any direct publisher control, their GAME being smaller
   in scope than those from the larger "AAA" GAME studios, and are often
   experiment in gameplay and art style. Indie GAME development are aided
   by larger availability of digital distribution, including the newer
   mobile gaming marker, and readily-available and low-cost development
   tools for these platforms.^[78]

   Main article: GAME studies

   Although departments of computer science have been studying the
   technical aspects of video GAME for years, theories that examine GAME
   as an artistic medium are a relatively recent development in the
   humanities. The two most visible schools in this emerging field are
   ludology and narratology. Narrativists approach video GAME in the
   context of what Janet Murray calls "Cyberdrama". That is to say, their
   major concern is with video GAME as a storytelling medium, one that
   arises out of interactive fiction. Murray puts video GAME in the
   context of the Holodeck, a fictional piece of technology from Star
   Trek, arguing for the video GAME as a medium in which the player is
   allowed to become another person, and to act out in another world.^[79]
   This image of video GAME received early widespread popular support,
   and forms the basis of films such as Tron, eXistenZ and The Last
   Starfighter.

   Ludologists break sharply and radically from this idea. They argue that
   a video GAME is first and foremost a GAME, which must be understood in
   terms of its rules, interface, and the concept of play that it deploys.
   Espen J. Aarseth argues that, although GAME certainly have plots,
   characters, and aspects of traditional narratives, these aspects are
   incidental to gameplay. For example, Aarseth is critical of the
   widespread attention that narrativists have given to the heroine of the
   GAME Tomb Raider, saying that "the dimensions of Lara Croft's body,
   already analyzed to death by film theorists, are irrelevant to me as a
   player, because a different-looking body would not make me play
   differently... When I play, I don't even see her body, but see through
   it and past it."^[80] Simply put, ludologists reject traditional
   theories of art because they claim that the artistic and socially
   relevant qualities of a video GAME are primarily determined by the
   underlying set of rules, demands, and expectations imposed on the
   player.

   While many GAME rely on emergent principles, video GAME commonly
   present simulated story worlds where emergent behavior occurs within
   the context of the GAME. The term "emergent narrative" has been used to
   describe how, in a simulated environment, storyline can be created
   simply by "what happens to the player."^[81] However, emergent behavior
   is not limited to sophisticated GAME. In general, any place where
   event-driven instructions occur for AI in a GAME, emergent behavior
   will exist. For instance, take a racing GAME in which cars are
   programmed to avoid crashing, and they encounter an obstacle in the
   track: the cars might then maneuver to avoid the obstacle causing the
   cars behind them to slow or maneuver to accommodate the cars in front
   of them and the obstacle. The programmer never wrote code to
   specifically create a traffic jam, yet one now exists in the GAME.

  Intellectual property for video GAME

   Main articles: Intellectual property protection of video GAME and
   Video GAME clone

   Most commonly, video GAME are protected by copyright, though both
   patents and trademarks have been used as well.

   Though local copyright regulations vary to the degree of protection,
   video GAME qualify as copyrighted visual-audio works, and enjoy
   cross-country protection under the Berne Convention.^[82] This
   typically only applies to the underlying code, as well as to the
   artistic aspects of the GAME such as its writing, art assets, and
   music. Gameplay itself is generally not considered copyrightable; in
   the United States among other countries, video GAME are considered to
   fall into the idea–expression distinction in that it is how the GAME is
   presented and expressed to the player that can be copyrighted, but not
   the underlying principles of the GAME.^[83]

   Because gameplay is normally ineligible for copyright, gameplay ideas
   in popular GAME are often replicated and built upon in other GAME. At
   times, this repurposing of gameplay can be seen as beneficial and a
   fundamental part of how the industry has grown by building on the ideas
   of others.^[84]^[85] For example Doom (1993) and Grand Theft Auto III
   (2001) introduced gameplay that created popular new GAME genres, the
   first-person shooter and the Grand Theft Auto clone, respectively, in
   the few years after their release.^[86]^[87] However, at times and more
   frequently at the onset of the industry, developers would intentionally
   create video GAME clones of successful GAME and GAME hardware with few
   changes, which led to the flooded arcade and dedicated home console
   market around 1978.^[84]^[88]^[85] Cloning is also a major issue with
   countries that do not have strong intellectual property protection
   laws, such as within China. The lax oversight by China's government and
   the difficulty for foreign companies to take Chinese entities to court
   had enabled China to support a large grey market of cloned hardware and
   software systems.^[89] The industry remains challenged to distinguish
   between creating new GAME based on refinements of past successful
   GAME to create a new type of gameplay, and intentionally creating a
   clone of a GAME that may simply swap out art assets.^[90]

Industry

   Main article: Video GAME industry

   [220px-Los_Angeles_-7_%287356846176%29.jpg] E3 is one of the typical
   trade show events of the video GAME industry.

  History

   The early history of the video GAME industry, following the first GAME
   hardware releases and through 1983, had little structure. Video GAME
   quickly took off during the golden age of arcade video GAME from the
   late 1970s to early 1980s, but the newfound industry was mainly
   composed of GAME developers with little business experience. This led
   to numerous companies forming simply to create clones of popular GAME
   to try to capitalize on the market.^[91] Due to loss of publishing
   control and oversaturation of the market, the North American home video
   GAME market crashed in 1983, dropping from revenues of around $3
   billion in 1983 to $100 million by 1985. Many of the North American
   companies created in the prior years closed down. Japan's growing GAME
   industry was briefly shocked by this crash but had sufficient longevity
   to withstand the short-term effects, and Nintendo helped to revitalize
   the industry with the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System in
   North America in 1985.^[91] Along with it, Nintendo established a
   number of core industrial practices to prevent unlicensed GAME
   development and control GAME distribution on their platform, methods
   that continue to be used by console manufacturers today.^[91]

   The industry remained more conservative following the 1983 crash,
   forming around the concept of publisher-developer dichotomies, and by
   the 2000s, leading to the industry centralizing around low-risk,
   triple-A GAME and studios with large development budgets of at least
   $10 million or more.^[92] The advent of the Internet brought digital
   distribution as a viable means to distribute GAME, and contributed to
   the growth of more riskier, experimental independent GAME development
   as an alternative to triple-A GAME in the late 2000s and which has
   continued to grow as a significant portion of the video GAME
   industry.^[93]^[78]

  Industry roles

   Video GAME have a large network effect that draw on many different
   sectors that tie into the larger video GAME industry. While video GAME
   developers are a significant portion of the industry, other key
   participants in the market include:^[94]
     * Publishers: Companies generally that oversee bringing the GAME from
       the developer to market. This often includes performing the
       marketing, public relations, and advertising of the GAME.
       Publishers frequently pay the developers ahead of time to make
       their GAME and will be involved in critical decisions about the
       direction of the GAME's progress, and then pay the developers
       additional royalties or bonuses based on sales performances. Other
       smaller, boutique publishers may simply offer to perform the
       publishing of a GAME for a small fee and a portion of the sales,
       and otherwise leave the developer with the creative freedom to
       proceed. A range of other publisher-developer relationships exist
       between these points.
     * Distributors: Publishers often are able to produce their own GAME
       media and take the role of distributor, but there are also
       third-party distributors that can mass-produce GAME media and
       distribute to retailers. Digital storefronts like Steam and the iOS
       App Store also serve as distributors and retailers in the digital
       space.
     * Retailers: Physical storefronts, which include large online
       retailers, department and electronic stores, and specialty video
       GAME stores, sell GAME, consoles, and other accessories to
       consumers. This has also including a trade-in market in certain
       regions, allowing players to turn in used GAME for partial refunds
       or credit towards other GAME. However, with the uprising of
       digital marketplaces and e-commerce revolution, retailers have been
       performing worse than in the past.
     * Hardware manufacturers: The video GAME console manufacturers
       produce console hardware, often through a value chain system that
       include numerous component suppliers and contract manufacturer that
       assemble the consoles. Further, these console manufacturers
       typically require a license to develop for their platform and may
       control the production of some GAME, such as Nintendo does with
       the use of GAME cartridges for its systems. In exchange, the
       manufacturers may help promote GAME for their system and may seek
       console exclusivity for certain GAME. For GAME on personal
       computers, a number of manufacturers are devoted to
       high-performance "gaming computer" hardware, particularly in the
       graphics card area; several of the same companies overlap with
       component supplies for consoles. A range of third-party
       manufacturers also exist to provide equipment and gear for consoles
       post-sale, such as additional controllers for console or carrying
       cases and gear for handheld devices.
     * Journalism: While journalism around video GAME used to be
       primarily print-based, and focused more on post-release reviews and
       gameplay strategy, the Internet has brought a more proactive press
       that use web journalism, covering GAME in the months prior to
       release as well as beyond, helping to build excitement for GAME
       ahead of release.
     * Influencers: With the rising importance of social media, video GAME
       companies have found that the opinions of influencers using
       streaming media to play through their GAME has had a significant
       impact on GAME sales, and have turned to use influencers alongside
       traditional journalism as a means to build up attention to their
       GAME before release.
     * Esports: Esports is a major function of several multiplayer GAME
       with numerous professional leagues established since the 2000s,
       with large viewership numbers, particularly out of southeast Asia
       since the 2010s.
     * Trade and advocacy groups: Trade groups like the Entertainment
       Software Association were established to provide a common voice for
       the industry in response to governmental and other advocacy
       concerns. They frequently set up the major trade events and
       conventions for the industry such as E3.
     * Gamers: Proactive hobbyists who are players and consumers of video
       GAME. While their representation in the industry is primarily seen
       through GAME sales, many companies follow gamers' comments on
       social media or on user reviews and engage with them to work to
       improve their products in addition to other feedback from other
       parts of the industry. Demographics of the larger player community
       also impact parts of the market; while once dominated by younger
       men, the market shifted in the mid-2010s towards women and older
       players who generally preferred mobile and causal GAME, leading to
       further growth in those sectors.^[95]

  Major regional markets

   See also: Video GAME industry § International practices

   The industry itself grew out from both the United States and Japan in
   the 1970s and 1980s before having a larger worldwide contribution.
   Today, the video GAME industry is predominantly led by major companies
   in North America (primarily the United States and Canada), Europe, and
   southeast Asia including Japan, South Korea, and China. Hardware
   production remains an area dominated by Asian companies either directly
   involved in hardware design or part of the production process, but
   digital distribution and indie GAME development of the late 2000s has
   allowed GAME developers to flourish nearly anywhere and diversify the
   field.^[96]

  GAME sales

   video GAME

   [220px-Videogameretaildisplay.jpg] A retail display in Switzerland with
   a large selection of GAME for platforms popular in the early 2000s

   According to the market research firm Newzoo, the global video GAME
   industry drew estimated revenues of over $159 billion in 2020. Mobile
   GAME accounted for the bulk of this, with a 48% share of the market,
   followed by console GAME at 28% and personal computer GAME at
   23%.^[1]

   Sales of different types of GAME vary widely between countries due to
   local preferences. Japanese consumers tend to purchase much more
   handheld GAME than console GAME and especially PC GAME, with a
   strong preference for GAME catering to local tastes.^[97]^[98] Another
   key difference is that, though having declined in the West, arcade
   GAME remain an important sector of the Japanese gaming industry.^[99]
   In South Korea, computer GAME are generally preferred over console
   GAME, especially MMORPG GAME and real-time strategy GAME. Computer
   GAME are also popular in China.^[100]

Effects on society

  Culture

   [220px-The_Art_of_Video_GAME_2012_%286848246182%29.jpg] The Art of
   Video GAME exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2012

   Video GAME culture is a worldwide new media subculture formed around
   video GAME and GAME playing. As computer and video GAME have
   increased in popularity over time, they have had a significant
   influence on popular culture. Video GAME culture has also evolved over
   time hand in hand with internet culture as well as the increasing
   popularity of mobile GAME. Many people who play video GAME identify
   as gamers, which can mean anything from someone who enjoys GAME to
   someone who is passionate about it. As video GAME become more social
   with multiplayer and online capability, gamers find themselves in
   growing social networks. Gaming can both be entertainment as well as
   competition, as a new trend known as electronic sports is becoming more
   widely accepted. In the 2010s, video GAME and discussions of video
   GAME trends and topics can be seen in social media, politics,
   television, film and music. The COVID-19 pandemic during 2020–2021 gave
   further visibility to video GAME as a pastime to enjoy with friends
   and family online as a means of social distancing.^[101]^[102]

   Main article: Video GAME as an art form

   Since the mid-2000s there has been debate whether video GAME qualify
   as art, primarily as the form's interactivity interfered with the
   artistic intent of the work and that they are designed for commercial
   appeal. A significant debate on the matter came after film critic Roger
   Ebert published an essay "Video GAME can never be art",^[103] which
   challenged the industry to prove him and other critics wrong.^[104] The
   view that video GAME were an art form was cemented in 2011 when the
   U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the landmark case Brown v. Entertainment
   Merchants Association that video GAME were a protected form of speech
   with artistic merit.^[105] Since then, video GAME developers have come
   to use the form more for artistic expression, including the development
   of art GAME,^[106] and the cultural heritage of video GAME as works
   of arts, beyond their technical capabilities, have been part of major
   museum exhibits, including The Art of Video GAME at the Smithsonian
   American Art Museum and toured at other museums from 2012 to 2016.

   Main articles: Film adaptation § Video GAME adaptation, and Hollywood
   and the video GAME industry

   Video GAME will inspire sequels and other video GAME within the same
   franchise, but also have influenced works outside of the video GAME
   medium. Numerous television shows (both animated and live-action),
   films, comics and novels have been created based on existing video GAME
   franchises. Because video GAME are an interactive medium there has
   been trouble in converting them to these passive forms of media, and
   typically such works have been critically panned or treated as
   children's media. For example, until 2019, no video GAME film had ever
   been received a "Fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but the releases of
   Detective Pikachu (2019) and Sonic the Hedgehog (2020), both receiving
   "Fresh" ratings, shows signs of the film industry having found an
   approach to adapt video GAME for the large screen.^[107]^[108] That
   said, some early video GAME-based films have been highly successful at
   the box office, such as 1995's Mortal Kombat and 2001's Lara Croft:
   Tomb Raider.^[109]

   More recently since the 2000s, there has also become a larger
   appreciation of video GAME music, which ranges from chiptunes composed
   for limited sound-output devices on early computers and consoles, to
   fully-scored compositions for most modern GAME. Such music has
   frequently served as a platform for covers and remixes, and concerts
   featuring video GAME soundtracks performed by bands or orchestras, such
   as Video GAME Live, have also become popular.^[109] Video GAME also
   frequently incorporate licensed music, particularly in the area of
   rhythm GAME, furthering the depth of which video GAME and music can
   work together.^[109]

   Further, video GAME can serve as a virtual environment under full
   control of a producer to create new works. With the capability to
   render 3D actors and settings in real-time, a new type of work
   machinima (short for "machine cinema") grew out from using video GAME
   engines to craft narratives.^[110] As video GAME engines gain higher
   fidelity, they have also become part of the tools used in more
   traditional filmmaking. Unreal Engine has been used as a backbone by
   Industrial Light &amp Magic for their StageCraft technology for shows like
   The Mandalorian.^[111]

   Separately, video GAME are also frequently used as part of the
   promotion and marketing for other media, such as for films, anime, and
   comics. However, these licensed GAME in the 1990s and 2000s often had
   a reputation for poor quality, developed without any input from the
   intellectual property rights owners, and several of them are considered
   among lists of GAME with notably negative reception, such as Superman
   64. More recently, with these licensed GAME being developed by
   triple-A studios or through studios directly connected to the licensed
   property owner, there has been a significant improvement in the quality
   of these GAME, with an early trendsetting example of Batman: Arkham
   Asylum.^[112]

   Main articles: Video GAME in education and Video GAME behavioral
   effects

   Besides their entertainment value, appropriately-designed video GAME
   have been seen to provide value in education across several ages and
   comprehension levels. Learning principles found in video GAME have
   been identified as possible techniques with which to reform the U.S.
   education system.^[113] It has been noticed that gamers adopt an
   attitude while playing that is of such high concentration, they do not
   realize they are learning, and that if the same attitude could be
   adopted at school, education would enjoy significant
   benefits.^[114]^[dubious – discuss] Students are found to be "learning
   by doing" while playing video GAME while fostering creative
   thinking.^[115]

   Video GAME are also believed to be beneficial to the mind and body. It
   has been shown that action video GAME players have better hand–eye
   coordination and visuo-motor skills, such as their resistance to
   distraction, their sensitivity to information in the peripheral vision
   and their ability to count briefly presented objects, than
   nonplayers.^[116] Researchers found that such enhanced abilities could
   be acquired by training with action GAME, involving challenges that
   switch attention between different locations, but not with GAME
   requiring concentration on single objects.^[citation needed] A 2018
   systematic review found evidence that video gaming training had
   positive effects on cognitive and emotional skills in the adult
   population, especially with young adults.^[117] A 2019 systematic
   review also added support for the claim that video GAME are beneficial
   to the brain, although the beneficial effects of video gaming on the
   brain differed by video GAME types.^[118]

   Organisers of video gaming events, such as the organisers of the D-Lux
   video GAME festival in Dumfries, Scotland, have emphasised the positive
   aspects video GAME can have on mental health. Organisers, mental
   health workers and mental health nurses at the event emphasised the
   relationships and friendships that can be built around video GAME and
   how playing GAME can help people learn about others as a precursor to
   discussing the person's mental health.^[119] A study in 2020 from
   Oxford University also suggested that playing video GAME can be a
   benefit to a person's mental health. The report of 3,274 gamers, all
   over the age of 18, focused on the GAME Animal Crossing: New Horizons
   and Plants vs Zombies: Battle for Neighborville and used actual
   play-time data. The report found that those that played more GAME
   tended to report greater "wellbeing".^[120]^[121] Also in 2020,
   computer science professor Regan Mandryk of the University of
   Saskatchewan said her research also showed that video GAME can have
   health benefits such as reducing stress and improving mental health.
   The university's research studied all age groups – "from pre-literate
   children through to older adults living in long term care homes" – with
   a main focus on 18 to 55-year-olds.^[122]

   A study of gamers attitudes towards gaming which was reported about in
   2018 found that millennials use video GAME as a key strategy for
   coping with stress. In the study of 1,000 gamers, 55% said that it
   "helps them to unwind and relieve stress ... and half said they see the
   value in gaming as a method of escapism to help them deal with daily
   work pressures".^[123]

   Main article: Video GAME controversies

   See also: Digital media use and mental health § Autism

   [220px-Compulsion_loop_for_video_GAME.svg.png] The compulsion loop for
   video GAME is believed to trigger dopamine release that can encourage
   addictive behavior.

   Video GAME have caused controversy since the 1970s.^[124] Parents and
   children's advocates regularly raise concerns that violent video GAME
   can influence young players into performing those violent acts in real
   life, and events such as the Columbine High School massacre in 1999 in
   which some claimed the perpetrators specifically alluded to using video
   GAME to plot out their attack, raised further fears.^[citation needed]
   Medical experts and mental health professionals have also raised
   concerned that video GAME may be addictive, and the World Health
   Organization has included "gaming disorder" in the 11th revision of its
   International Statistical Classification of Diseases. Other health
   experts, including the American Psychiatric Association, have stated
   that there is insufficient evidence that video GAME can create violent
   tendencies or lead to addictive behavior,^[125] though agree that video
   GAME typically use a compulsion loop in their core design that can
   create dopamine that can help reinforce the desire to continue to play
   through that compulsion loop and potentially lead into violent or
   addictive behavior.^[126]^[127]^[128] Even with case law establishing
   that video GAME qualify as a protected art form, there has been
   pressure on the video GAME industry to keep their products in check to
   avoid over-excessive violence particularly for GAME aimed at younger
   children. The potential addictive behavior around GAME, coupled with
   increased used of post-sale monetization of video GAME, has also
   raised concern among parents, advocates, and government officials about
   gambling tendencies that may come from video GAME, such as controversy
   around the use of loot boxes in many high-profile GAME.

   Numerous other controversies around video GAME and its industry have
   arisen over the years, among the more notable incidents include the
   1993 United States Congressional hearings on violent GAME like Mortal
   Kombat which lead to the formation of the ESRB ratings system, numerous
   legal actions taken by attorney Jack Thompson over violent GAME such
   as Grand Theft Auto III and Manhunt from 2003 to 2007, the outrage over
   the "No Russian" level from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 in 2009
   which allowed the player to shoot a number of innocent non-player
   characters at an airport, and the Gamergate harassment campaign in 2014
   that highlighted misogyny from a portion of the player demographic. The
   industry as a whole has also dealt with issues related to gender,
   racial, and LGBTQ+ discrimination and mischaracterization of these
   minority groups in video GAME. A further issue in the industry is
   related to working conditions, as development studios and publishers
   frequently use "crunch time", required extended working hours, in the
   weeks and months ahead of a GAME's release to assure on-time delivery.

Collecting and preservation

   Main articles: Video GAME collecting and Video GAME preservation

   See also: List of video GAME museums

   Players of video GAME often maintain collections of GAME. More
   recently there has been interest in retrogaming, focusing on GAME from
   the first decades. GAME in retail packaging in good shape have become
   collectors items for the early days of the industry, with some rare
   publications having gone for over US$100,000 as of 2020^[update].
   Separately, there is also concern about the preservation of video
   GAME, as both GAME media and the hardware to play them degrade over
   time. Further, many of the GAME developers and publishers from the
   first decades no longer exist, so records of their GAME have
   disappeared. Archivists and preservations have worked within the scope
   of copyright law to save these GAME as part of the cultural history of
   the industry.

   There are many video GAME museums around the world, including the
   National VideoGAME Museum in Frisco, Texas,^[129] which serves as the
   largest museum wholly dedicated to the display and preservation of the
   industry's most important artifacts.^[130] Europe hosts video GAME
   museums such as the Computer GAME Museum in Berlin^[131] and the
   Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines in Moscow and
   Saint-Petersburg.^[132]^[133] The Museum of Art and Digital
   Entertainment in Oakland, California is a dedicated video GAME museum
   focusing on playable exhibits of console and computer GAME.^[134] The
   Video GAME Museum of Rome is also dedicated to preserving video GAME
   and their history.^[135] The International Center for the History of
   Electronic GAME at The Strong in Rochester, New York contains one of
   the largest collections of electronic GAME and GAME-related historical
   materials in the world, including a 5,000-square-foot (460 m^2) exhibit
   which allows guests to play their way through the history of video
   GAME.^[136]^[137]^[138] The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC
   has three video GAME on permanent display: Pac-Man, Dragon's Lair, and
   Pong.^[139]

   The Museum of Modern Art has added a total of 20 video GAME and one
   video GAME console to its permanent Architecture and Design Collection
   since 2012.^[140]^[141] In 2012, the Smithsonian American Art Museum
   ran an exhibition on "The Art of Video GAME".^[142] However, the
   reviews of the exhibit were mixed, including questioning whether video
   GAME belong in an art museum.^[143]^[144]

Charades

Description

   Players break up into teams and write the names of movies/shows/famous

   paper and try to act out the movie/show/famous person without making a
   sound. His/her teammates try to guess and if they are successful, the
   player continues choosing papers until the timer runs out. Whichever
   team can get through the most wins!

Example

   Gettysburg Address. He then points to an imaginary top hat and long
   beard. His teammates finally guess Abraham Lincoln and they move onto

Example

   Caroline spins around the bat until she is very dizzy. She then leans

Duck Duck Goose

Description

   child must make it around the circle to the sitting place of the
   ‘goose’ child, while the ‘goose’ child must attempt to tag the ‘it’
   child before he/she makes it to where the ‘goose’ was sitting.

Example

   All of the children are sitting in a circle and Isabelle is walking
   around tapping everyone on the head, saying ‘Duck’ for each person she
   taps. Then she taps Linda on the head and says ‘Goose’. Linda gets up
   to chase Isabelle as Isabelle runs around the circle and tries to get
   back to Linda’s vacated space in the circle. Isabelle makes it before
   Linda can tag her, so now Linda gets to be the tapper.

   measuring cup. The team that transfers the most wins.

   wins.
   (BUTTON)

Description

   All children begin dancing when the music is playing, but when the

   extra dance move after the music has stopped, so he is out!
   (BUTTON)

   Have everyone write the name of an object or famous person on pieces of
   paper and then mix them all together. Break into two teams. Each team

   on a sheet of paper so that his/her team can guess what he/she is
   drawing. The artist cannot talk or write words or letters.

Example

   John chooses the clue ‘elephant’ and then tries to draw it. His
   teammates guess it correctly so he moves onto the next clue. They
   repeat until the one minute is up.
   (BUTTON)

Hats

Description

   All players wear hats throughout the evening - pass them out at the
   beginning of the night. At the beginning of the night, one person is
   chosen to be the hat man/woman. Whenever he/she takes off their hat
   throughout the night, everyone in the room must follow suit. Whoever
   still has the hat on loses!

Example

   Taylor is the hat woman. During the night, Uncle Jimmy is in the middle
   of a story and Taylor discreetly takes her hat off. Most people see her
   and take their hat off. Only Uncle Jimmy is left because he does not
   notice. He loses.
   (BUTTON)

Hot Potato

Description

   All children should sit in a circle with one standing with his/her eyes
   closed. The players sitting in the circle pass a ball to each other. No
   player can hold the ball for more than a second. At any point the
   standing player can yell ‘HOT POTATO!’ and whoever is holding the ball
   at that time is the out!

Example

   All children are sitting in a circle, except for Susie. She is standing
   with her eyes closed. The sitting children are throwing the ball to
   each other, being careful not to hold it for more than a second. Then
   Susie yells "Hot Potato!" and Melinda is holding the ball. She is out!
   (BUTTON)

Description

   Hand out ice cubes to everyone. When the GAME starts, players can try
   everything they can to melt the ice cube quicker than their opponents.
   They can rub it between their hands or on their shirt, or blow on it.
   Whoever melts it first wins! No cheating (you cannot put it in your
   mouth or stomp on it or use equipment to melt it).

Example

   John is given an icecube. At the start of the GAME he blows hot air on
   the ice cube with his mouth to try to melt it. He does it faster than
   anyone else and wins.
   (BUTTON)

It’s a Ping Pong Ball

Description

   Two children sit on opposite sides of a table on their knees with their
   arms behind their back. A ping pong ball is placed in the middle of the
   table. When the judge says GO, they both try to blow the ping pong ball
   off the opponents’ side of the table.

Example

   Gregory and Allison are at separate ends of the table. The ping pong
   ball is placed in the middle and the judge signals to start blowing.
   Allison blows so hard that the ball falls off of the table on Gregory’s
   side. Allison Wins!
   (BUTTON)

Let Them Eat Cake

Description

   Set slices of cake on plates around the table in front of each child.
   When the GAME starts all children begin to eat the cake using only
   their mouth and keeping their hands behind their back.

Example

   Cameron has a piece of cake in front of him. The GAME starts and he
   works to eat the piece of cake using only his mouth. He is able to
   finish the entire piece before everyone else, so he wins.
   (BUTTON)

Like and Dislike

Description

   Each person grabs a blank card and writes one thing they love and one
   thing they hate. Then, shuffle the cards and redistribute. Each player
   takes guesses at who wrote the card they received.

Example

   After everyone writes down their dislike and likes on a card and then
   shuffles and redistributes, Caroline chooses to read first. She reads
   ‘I like baseball, but I hate snakes.’ Then, each player takes turns
   guessing who it was that wrote that card. Caroline chooses Vince, while
   Eric and Stefanie think it was Fred. It was Vince!
   (BUTTON)

Limbo

Description

   Have two people hold opposite ends of a pole. Players take turns trying
   to walk under the pole by leaning backwards. If a player falls or
   touches the pole, he/she is out. Each round the pole gets slightly
   lower.

Example

   Julissa is trying to walk under the pole. She leans backwards so that
   she can make it under. Unfortunately she hits the pole with her
   forehead so she is out. Next Sherry tries to make it under the pole and
   does so without touching it or falling so she gets to move onto the
   next round.
   (BUTTON)

Mummy Wrap

Description

   Divide children into two teams and assign each team a ‘mummy’. Give
   each team one roll of toilet paper. When the GAME starts, the kids must
   wrap the ‘mummy’ in toilet paper. Whichever team finishes their roll of
   toilet paper first is the winner.

Example

   Vince is chosen to be the mummy. His team hurries to wrap him up in
   toilet paper. They finish their roll before the other team, therefore
   they are the winners!
   (BUTTON)

Musical Chairs

Description

   Set up chairs so that there is one less chair than there are number of
   players. Children are instructed to walk in a circle around the chairs
   as music plays. When the music stops, the children must sit in a seat.
   Whoever is without a seat is out. Each round you take away a chair
   until there is only one player left!

Example

   Four kids are walking around a group of three chairs. When the music
   stops, Jim tries to get to a chair but Timmy, Alice, and Trevor sit in
   seats before he can get to one. Jim is out. The GAME continues until
   there is only one person left sitting.
   (BUTTON)

   starts a story then passes the pen and paper to the next person in
   line. They add a sentence, continuing the story. This continues until
   the last person gets to write a sentence to finish the story. Then you
   read the mashup story aloud.

Example

   Derek starts the story by writing, ‘A man is walking down the
   street...’, then Leslie goes next and writes, ‘and then he trips and
   falls.’ Then Samuel takes the paper and continues the story to say,
   ‘when he gets up he realizes he has lost his glasses...’ They continue

   story is finished.

   first conversation with Susie, Susie says the word "cute". Liz catches
   her and Susie has to give up her necklace.
   (BUTTON)

Orange Pass

Description

   Players hold an orange between their chin and neck. They then attempt
   to pass an orange from one player to another without using their hands.

   body sideways so that Cindy can grab the orange with her neck and chin.
   They drop the orange so they lose.
   (BUTTON)

Party Bag

Description

   Start by placing assorted items into a brown paper bag without the
   children seeing. Try everyday objects like candy, fruit, toothpicks, or
   Q tips. Each child then takes turns feeling into the bag and guessing
   what the objects are. Whoever guesses the most wins.

Example

   sunglasses, and rubber band. Susan then goes and thinks she feels a
   hairbrush, sunglasses and string. Frank was correct, so he wins!
   (BUTTON)

   Players try to get the prize while still keeping their arms linked in

   that is closest wins!

Example

   Mom tapes a donkey to the far wall in the room. She gives little Susan
   a tail cut-out and blindfolds her. Susan then slowly tries to tape the
   tail to the correct spot on the donkey. Then her friend Zoe attempts
   the same. Zoe is closest so she wins!
   (BUTTON)

   pattern. Then the psychiatrist comes back in and asks everyone
   questions (which they answer as if they are the person they are
   impersonating) and tries to figures out the pattern.

Example

   Greg leaves the room. Everyone else in the room decides that they will
   impersonate the person to their left. Greg comes back and asks the
   first person what color hair they have, or what their age is. This
   helps Greg figure out the pattern and win the GAME.

   during RED LIGHT must go back to start. Whoever crosses the finish line
   wins.

Example

   whispering a phrase in the ear of the person on his/her left. This gets
   repeated all the way around the circle until it reaches the start.

Example

   Taylor. Then Taylor whispers what she thought she heard into the ear of

Who Am I

Description

   Each player writes a name of a famous person on a card. The card is

   the card.

Example

   John has the name ‘President Obama’ on his card. He asks, ‘Am I
   famous?’, and the group answers, ‘Yes’. Next, Gwen, who has the name
   ‘Pocahontas’ on her forehead, asks ‘Am I male?’ and the group says,

   Eight examples that explain all you need to know about serious GAME
   and GAME-based learning

Eight examples that explain all you need to know about serious GAME and
GAME-based learning

   Gamelearn Team 06 Mar / 2017

   At first sight, putting words like “serious” and “GAME” together might
   seem impossible, but it’s not. In recent years, serious GAME have
   proven that it is possible to learn while you play. This teaching
   method is known as GAME-based learning, a trend that’s expanding at the
   speed of light in primary schools, prestigious universities and large
   corporations. In this post, we’re going to tell you all you need to
   know about serious GAME and learning through video GAME, including
   their main characteristics and benefits, and a few prime examples.

What is a serious GAME?

   Serious GAME are GAME whose primary objective is NOT fun or
   entertainment, rather learning or practicing a skill. Its use has
   grown, particularly in such sectors as education, defense, aeronautics,
   science or health. Its purpose can be one of many: from training
   firefighter crews in emergency situations to training a sales team,
   teaching mathematics or practicing a language.

Example 1: Dragon Box Elements

   In the field of education, one of the most simple (and effective) GAME
   is Dragon Box Elements. Here, players have to build an army, defeat the
   evil dragon Osgard and save Euclid’s island. Designed for kids of nine
   years-of-age and upwards, to manage all that, they have to learn basic
   geometry and the theorems of Euclid himself. Dragon Box is a good
   example of a serious GAME: the students learn math while they have fun
   with a video GAME.

What is GAME-based learning?

   The method that uses video GAME for learning purposes is known as
   GAME-based learning. The key lies in the fact that the content and the
   skills that you want to teach are not put across in a face-to-face
   class or in a book but rather through video GAME. Advocates of this
   innovative method of teaching think that video GAME can be a fun and
   effective tool at one and the same time, reducing the costs of training
   programs, increasing student motivation and facilitating direct
   practice. The star products of GAME-based learning are precisely,
   serious GAME.

Example 2: Pulse!!

   The healthcare sector has enthusiastically welcomed this innovative
   method of teaching. The expert in nursing, Claudia Johnston, based
   herself on first-person shooting video GAME (such as Quake or Duke to
   develop Pulse!!, which reproduces the conditions of an emergency ward
   in a hospital. Thanks to this video GAME, future nurses can practice
   all they have learnt in their theoretical classes and gain experience
   handling real situations. The goal of the players is to identify each
   patient’s problem, giving priority to the most serious cases and
   applying the appropriate measures depending on each person’s condition.

The 5 elements of a serious GAME

   It’s no easy task to create a serious GAME: it requires a lot of
   talent, a lot of time and a lot of money. Although there is a huge
   variety of formats and objectives, most GAME-based learning systems
   tend to have five elements that ensure they work properly and are
   effective:

   1 – A story. Although it is by no means essential, most video GAME
   have a plot or a main story. It may be a prince risking life and limb
   to rescue a princess or a brave soldier who has to put paid to his
   enemy. Or, as we have seen, it may also be a nurse who has to save a
   patient’s life. The more sophisticated the argument (and the
   characters), the easier it will be to motivate the players and for them
   to get into the GAME.

Example 3: Pacific

   The video GAME Pacific starts just there, with a story: while on a
   humanitarian mission, a team’s plane crashes and they are trapped on an
   island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The player’s objective is to
   lead their team while they build a hot-air balloon so that they can
   escape from the island and return home safe and sound. To do so, they
   have to learn all the virtues of a good leader and team manager (skills
   that every company is calling out for), including motivating and
   rewarding their colleagues, resolving conflicts, delegating tasks or
   coaching them. That’s the only way they can hope to get off the island.

   2 – Gamification. The second fundamental element of any serious GAME
   are the GAME dynamics, which include the rankings, rewards, badges or
   points systems. This gamification tends to animate and motivate the
   players: we all love to get more coins, obtain more lives or pass
   through to the next level (remember Mario Bros?). Classifications or
   rankings are also very important in serious GAME: healthy competition
   with our classmates or work colleagues encourage us to try that bit
   harder and to do everything possible to beat our rivals.

Example 4: Duolingo

   Many of these elements can be seen in the famous language application,
   Duolingo. While users learn English, Spanish, French or German, they
   receive points, go up to the next level, lose lives or outdo their
   friends and relations. Each lesson they learn has a reward. Even though
   Duolingo is not strictly speaking a serious GAME, it is one of the most
   successful applications when it comes to using gamification elements
   for learning.

   3 – Immediate and individualized feedback. As opposed to face-to-face
   courses (normally with dozens of people in the classroom and one single
   teacher), serious GAME offer immediate and personalized feedback. The
   player interacts directly with the GAME and instantly receives a reward
   or a punishment. In the most sophisticated video GAME, this feedback
   is also detailed and argued: users can know where they have gone wrong
   and can try to do better next time. If properly imparted, this feedback
   can be a powerful learning tool.

   4 – Simulation. In most cases, serious GAME reproduce or imitate real
   life situations. Using fictitious characters and by recreating
   scenarios, players find themselves immersed in a world similar to the
   one they will find beyond the screen of their computer or their cell
   phone. These simulators make it possible for users to interact with a
   new reality and to practice the skills and concepts they have acquired
   during the GAME.

Example 5: The Virtual Interactive Combat Environment (VICE)

   Simulators have been used to great effect when training surgeons,
   aircraft pilots or military personnel. The most outstanding institution
   in this latter field is undoubtedly the United States Defense
   Department, probably the public body which has dedicated most money and
   resources to GAME-based learning in the last number of decades. One of
   its best-known video GAME is The Virtual Interactive Combat
   Environment (VICE), which uses a sophisticated 3D simulator to allow
   military personnel to practice conflict resolution, how to use
   regulatory equipment, communicate with the rest of the team or act in a
   war scenario.

   5 – The goal: to learn. We’ll not tire of repeating it: the key element
   of serious GAME is that their purpose is to teach something. All the
   elements we’ve mentioned above can be found in endless commercial video
   GAME, but that does not necessarily make them serious GAME. As well
   as using all these elements, serious GAME also have to have a purpose
   that is not recreational and that almost always has to do with a
   certain educational or training aspect.

What are the advantages of GAME-based learning and serious GAME?

   When all the above elements are combined successfully, we have a
   powerful learning tool. The use of a narrative, gamification
   techniques, simulators and feedback during the teaching process imply
   numerous benefits when compared to face-to-face learning or e-learning.
   These are the five most outstanding advantages:

   1 – They increase engagement and motivation

   We’ve all suffered some of the negative aspects of traditional
   education: long hours sat listening to a teacher, endless theories laid
   out in a book and next to no interaction with the content matter.
   Whether we’re talking about adolescents in a school or workers in a
   company, the lack of motivation and engagement in students is one of
   the major concerns of teachers and HR managers.

   Serious GAME and GAME-based learning are two of the best solutions to
   this problem. Video GAME are necessarily interactive and users have to
   make decisions from the word go. GAME dynamics encourage effort and the
   narrative they are wrapped up in serves to motivate the students. The
   most sophisticated video GAME can even turn learning into an
   addiction. As they explain in the book The Gamification of Learning and
   Instruction Fieldbook, “The more the learner interacts with other
   learners, the content, and the instructor, the more likely it is that
   learning will actually occur.”

Example 6: Our City

   Millennials (both in school and at work) are one of the sectors where
   it can prove hardest to achieve engagement. To solve that problem, in
   Jordan they have developed a video GAME on Facebook called “Our City”,
   which seeks to get people between 15 and 24 involved in their local
   communities, enhance their social behavior and invite them to take part
   in the life of the city. The GAME, which has certain similarities with
   the popular The Sims, makes young people mayors, and it allows them to
   build the city from scratch while keeping all the townspeople happy at
   the same time. Some of the challenges they face include developing
   basic public services (such as health or education) and improving the
   transport in the city.

   2 – They facilitate profound reflection

   Quite often, particularly in the labor world, we work in a humdrum and
   repetitive environment where we prioritize the most urgent tasks one
   day and the next. This makes it hard to strategically plan for the long
   term, and it prevents us from reflecting in any profound way on the
   challenges and opportunities we are facing. Serious GAME, thanks to
   how they can immerse us in other worlds and whisk us away from reality,
   can provide just the distance we need to encourage in-depth reflection
   and thoughts.

   3 – They facilitate real and safe practice

   As opposed to face-to-face training, GAME-based learning is a form of
   learning that is based on practice. Thanks to the simulators, the
   players can interact with other characters and they can use the
   knowledge they have gained from the outset. Serious GAME also offer
   the best of both worlds: on the one hand, the simulators should
   reproduce reality as faithfully as possible; on the other hand, the
   fact that it is a video GAME allows users to practice in safety without
   any risk of personal harm or material damage. This is particularly
   important if we are talking about operating in a surgery or flying a
   plane.

Example 7: Merchants

   Real and direct practice is also vital in the corporate world. As is
   the case with the video GAME Merchants (part of the Gamelearn
   platform), which trains employees in any manner of company in how to
   negotiate and in how to resolve conflicts. In Merchants, the players
   are transported to the Venice of the late 15th century. Here they have
   to endeavor to build their commercial empire and to face up to tough
   negotiators such as Machiavelli. This video GAME allows the employees
   of a multinational to handle difficult negotiations that they can then
   apply in the real world, but without their company having to pay the
   price of any errors that are part and parcel of any learning process.

   4 – They improve memorization and retention

   One of the advantages of serious GAME is that by increasing the
   engagement and the motivation of the students, they also increase their
   memorization and retention of what they have learnt. Add to this real
   and direct practice and the result is that the students learn better
   and more deeply. Several scientific studies have proven that learning
   by doing makes a more effective and long-lasting impact on students’
   brains.

   5 – They make the world a better place

   That may well sound overly ambitious, but the fact is that several
   serious GAME have also been so bold as to attempt to change the world.
   The fact that we like gamification and simulators can be a good tool
   for encouraging empathy, promoting peace, defending people’s rights or
   spreading civic values. As opposed to the stereotype by which video
   GAME are a cause of antisocial or violent behavior, the reality is
   that GAME-based learning can encourage prosocial and positive attitudes
   for society as a whole.

Example 8: Food Force

   In 2005, the United Nations World Food Programme developed a video GAME
   to promote social awareness and the fight against hunger. In the video
   GAME (Food Force) the players put themselves in the shoes of a UN
   rookie, who has to handle a crisis involving famine and civil war on an
   island in the Pacific. The player’s goal is to distribute food among
   the populace and to help the country to become self-sufficient in the
   medium to long term. A fantastic example of how serious GAME can make
   the world a better place.

The success of serious GAME and GAME-based learning

   All these benefits have placed GAME-based learning at the vanguard of
   the revolution in education that the world of teaching and corporative
   training is experiencing at the moment. Many of these more or less
   sophisticated video GAME are used every day by millions of people (in
   many cases, without their even realizing it). For example, in the
   United Kingdom, most players (33%) prefer video GAME to puzzles, word
   GAME or trivial pursuits. Although not all of them can be considered
   serious GAME, it is a good indicator of the growing acceptance of
   GAME-based learning throughout the world.

   Serious GAME are also a very serious business. According to estimates
   made by the consultancy Marketandmarkets, this sector will grow between
   2015 and 2020 at an average annual rate of 16.38%, which will mean that
   last year the business will have reached 5.449 billion dollars. There
   is a growing demand for learning through video GAME and little by
   little, the market is responding to that demand.

   The reasons why GAME-based learning is so popular, are becoming much
   more well known: as we have seen, they improve student engagement and
   motivation, they afford direct practice without risk, and they
   facilitate the memorization and retention of knowledge. While serious
   GAME have been around for centuries (let’s not forget that ever since
   we were small we’ve all been learning as we play), the social and
   technological changes of recent years are extending GAME-based learning
   to the four corners of the planet. Whether it is to improve the
   training of nurses, to help primary school kids learn geometry or to
   promote leadership skills among the employees of a company, serious
   GAME have become one of the most practical and effective teaching
   tools in the world today.

Why We Play BoardGAME

   My husband and I have spent the last ten years playing board GAME
   together. No, I’m not talking about seeing if we need anger management
   classes by playing Monopoly or choosing which career path we want to
   pursue in Life. I’m talking about making the life or death decision of
   which city to cure of a disease lest an outbreak occur in Pandemic,
   cackling like a maniac when you oust your opponent with a direct hit of
   four attack strikes to become the baddest monster in King of Tokyo, and
   smartly building and managing the best winery in pre-modern Tuscany in
   Viticulture.

   The world of board gaming has changed so much since the days of
   Monopoly, Life, and Battleship. When my husband and I started dating,
   we weren’t really into the “typical” dates. Rather than dinner and a
   movie or going to college parties, we spent the majority of our time
   together learning card GAME, and teaching each other our family
   favorites. When we tired of Canasta and Sequence, we began looking for
   something new and stumbled into the world of hobby board gaming. We
   started out slow like a swimmer testing the water, and over the years
   have dove head first into the deep end where our hobby has grown into
   shelves full of GAME that have brought us, our family, and our friends
   closer together through hours spent laughing, playing, and enjoying
   each others company over the many different GAME brought to the table.

   While this is definitely a hobby of ours, over the years and as our
   family has grown, it has morphed into a passion of sorts. There are so
   many reasons why we love board gaming and why we have made it an
   important part of our family for us and our four kids. We think that
   every family can benefit by incorporating board GAME into their lives.
   Yes, I know that may sound a bit nerdy, but here us out.

   Family Bonding

   Juggling the commitments of a family is no joke. As a parent you are
   pulled in every direction from sun up to sun down – from work, school,
   running a household, and getting everyone to their events on time
   things can get a little hectic. Our lives get so busy and scheduled
   that we decided it was important that, like we do for dance and soccer,
   we make sure to actually schedule time for our family to just be
   together and bond; no places to be except home with each other. We use
   this time to play GAME with our kids. Now, our kids are young, so it’s
   not always as idyllic as we go into it hoping it will be. But what we
   see is our kids engaged with each other learning to take turns, follow
   rules, make tough choices, and win or lose graciously. Its time spent
   making memories and connecting with each other. Rather than sitting and
   watching a show, they are working together to solve problems and
   complete goals all in a fun, controlled setting. If there’s one thing
   we hope our kids look back on fondly as adults and incorporate into
   their own lives, its the importance of spending meaningful time
   together and finding joy in simple fun, whether that comes from a board
   GAME or not.

   GAME also allow us to have great date nights at home. Finding a sitter
   for four kids 6 and under can be hard, and after paying for the sitter,
   dinner, and perhaps a movie, we’ve racked up quite the bill. While we
   try to get out as often as we can, we also try to make sure that for
   when we can’t we are still making time for us to be together and pursue
   one another. We’ll put the kids to bed, come downstairs, and for a few
   hours we’ll take time to play a GAME. Maybe we’ll even spend what we
   would have spent on a date and get a new GAME to enjoy; when it comes
   to bang for your buck, you can’t beat buying a board GAME that you will
   be able to enjoy a countless number of times rather than just once.

   Less Screen Time

   Like most families, we are looking for ways to decrease the screen time
   in our family. And I’m not just talking about our kids’. Technology is
   quickly taking over every aspect of our lives, we have the ability to
   have “smart” everything: smart phones, smart TVs, smart lightbulbs,
   smart toothbrushes (yes, seriously,) smart speakers and on and on! The
   pull of technology is everywhere and everyone has an opinion on what
   amount is good and what isn’t. I’m no expert on that, and I engage in a
   fair amount of “plugged-in” entertainment myself, but what I do know,
   is that as technology has taken over more of my life, I am looking for
   more and more ways to unplug. When we spend a night engaged in a board
   GAME, we walk away with memories, laughs, and a fun experience that can
   only come from face-to-face social interaction. Board GAME are
   incredibly versatile; you can take them with you to play indoors or
   out, and they open the door for a wonderful social experience with your
   friends and family where you can enjoy some friendly competition or
   even cooperative play and still engage in the great conversation that
   we all long for.

   Brain Food

   You’d be surprised by the level of mental engagement required to play
   modern board GAME. In GAME like Candyland, the winner is already
   determined before the first card has even been flipped – there is
   nothing you can do. But in today’s board GAME you have a variety of
   styles, from puzzles to tactical area control GAME to keep you and
   your brain sharp and always thinking. The challenges provided by
   physical board GAME are better than anything you’ll find in some app,
   even apps of the board GAME you might be playing.

   The strategy required to play and win requires you to make touch
   choices and weigh your options, to look at the board and think not only
   about what the best move for you is, but also the best move for your
   opponent and how to block them. Or they invite you to work together to
   solve problems as you play cooperatively. And thats to say nothing of
   the reading and language skills required to interpret the rules,
   hand-eye dexterity enhancment, and math skills required to play the
   GAME itself.  Whether you’re playing a difficult strategy GAME or a
   light hearted party GAME, there are an endless number of options that
   invite you to think through a variety of mental challenges, making you
   perhaps just a bit smarter along the way.

   Something for Everyone

   As mentioned above, we have been hobbyist board gamers for the last ten
   years, which seems kind of crazy thinking about it. But over the years
   this really has developed into a passion for us. We board GAME for many
   reasons, more than even listed above, but the main reason is, without a
   doubt, for the experiences it provides between us and our family and
   friends. We love being able to gather round a table, phones aside, and
   spend time connecting with people, old friends and new. The board GAME
   is really just a vehicle for us to bring people together and enjoy each
   others company. Over the last ten years we’ve had our fair share of
   friends and family that have told us that they “don’t like board GAME”
   and time and time again, we’ve found that there truly is something for
   everyone in this hobby.

   You don’t have to like every GAME, we certainly don’t, but the
   diversity offered by today’s GAME is simply incredible and if you’ve
   made it this far down this post and are wondering where to start, then
   you’re in luck! What would a post about the benefits of board gaming
   with your family be if we didn’t give at least a few suggestions. This
   hobby is truly a joy and is something that we love to share with anyone
   who will let us and especially our kids who have no choice! So without
   further ado, here are some board GAME ideas to get you started!

   Happy Gaming!

   Ticket to Ride

   This GAME has really broken through the hobby wall and has become much
   more mainstream over the years, you may have even seen it in your local
   Target. This GAME is simple to learn, but far more layered in its
   tactical strategy. Players collect cards of various types of train cars
   that they then use to claim railway routes across North America. The
   longer the route, the more points earned. Along the way you try to
   complete Destination Tickets, secret routes connecting distant cities
   that will score you more points at the end of the GAME. You must
   balance greed as you take on more routes to earn more points, and fear
   as you might lose a critical route to a competitor and thus cost
   yourself points in the end.

   This GAME has a multitude of expansions offering different train maps
   featuring different countries and states, but we recommend the original
   GAME with the North American map to start and it is great for the whole
   family starting at about age 8.

   Pandemic

   More of a cooperative player? Great! You might love Pandemic! In this
   GAME several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all
   across the globe and it is your mission to fight these while
   researching cures before they take over the world. Players take on
   unique roles as disease-fighting specialists, each with their own
   powers and capabilities and must strategize together to decide where
   help is needed most and find a way to control the contagions before the
   situation gets out of hand.

   This GAME is incredibly fun and endlessly re-playable. Start at a
   beginners difficulty level, once you’ve mastered that, work your way up
   to expert and see if you’ve got what it takes. This is a great way to
   work on your kids’ problem solving skills and is best for gamers of all
   ages starting at age 10.

   King of Tokyo

   If you know how to play Yahtzee you can play this GAME, promise! King
   of Tokyo is a hit with everyone as players take on the role of mutant
   monsters, robots, and aliens all trying to destroy the other and become
   the lone remaining King of Tokyo. You roll six dice Yahtzee style,
   setting what you want to keep aside, and rolling the rest up to two
   more times in an effort to either win victory points, gain energy,
   restore your health, or attack other players to let them know Tokyo
   belongs to YOU. But be warned, if you stand inside Tokyo, you must face
   all the other monsters alone as they attempt to knock you off your
   thrown.

   With a little help from an adult, King of Tokyo can easily be played by
   gamers as young as 6, but don’t let that deter you, this is far from a
   kid GAME and will offer tons of fun for teens and adult gamers as
   well.

   Survive: Escape from Atlantis!

   Survive is a simple, yet cutthroat GAME where players try to evacuate
   their pieces from an island that is breaking up while remembering where
   their highest-valued pieces are located to maximize score. The journey
   to shore is anything but simple however as players must navigate waters
   filled with boat tipping whales, fast moving sharks, and fearsome sea
   monsters. Find out who your true friends are as you all attempt to
   sabotage each other’s escape plans so you can stand victorious with the
   most points on shore before the island blows up. This GAME plays up to
   four and works well for ages 6 and above.

   Background: Internet gaming disorder (IGD) was recently added in the
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder as a “condition
   for further studies.” There is no consensus regarding which rating
   scales should be used but many scholars suggest the GASA (GAME
   Addiction Scale for Adolescents) and a ranking of the criteria, “the
   core approach” to avoid over-diagnosing of disordered gaming. Male
   gender and ADHD are commonly listed as risk factors for disordered
   gaming but little is known about sex differences in gaming and gender
   specific health correlates.

   Purpose: The present study aims to evaluate the core approach and the
   specific indicators of gaming behavior in GASA from a multifactorial
   perspective and explore the gender differences in a clinical setting,
   focusing on ADHD.

   Patients and Methods: Children and adolescents aged 8–18 years (n =
   144) from Child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) in Skane were assessed
   with the GASA. Psychometric analyses including confirmatory factor
   analyses (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to
   identify well-defined constructs and gender differences. Refined factor
   scores for single constructs were the outcome of alignment, a procedure
   for assessing measurement equivalence across gender. New model-based
   gaming behavior variables were used for descriptive statistics and
   ANOVA testing of gender differences.

   Results: The results confirm that the core approach two-factor model is
   valid for the CAP sample, as well as a theory based psycho-social model
   for gaming behavior with over consumption and negative social and
   emotional consequences. Our findings suggest that negative consequences
   of over consumption take a social direction for boys and an emotional
   direction for girls. Also, ADHD was significantly associated with over
   consumption of video GAME and the negative consequences thereof for
   girls.

   Conclusion: Guided by psychometric analyses, the GASA could be
   strengthened by advancing the questionnaire design and by adding
   complementary items in order to illuminate the complexity of gaming
   behavior. Our findings suggest that additional research on potential
   gender related discrepancies of disordered gaming is needed.

Introduction

   In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)
   the American Psychiatry Association (APA) identified Internet Gaming
   Disorder as a tentative diagnose; a “condition for further studies”
   (1). Nine criteria for IGD has been proposed: preoccupation,
   preoccupation with gaming; withdrawal, experience of unpleasant
   symptoms when gaming is taken away; tolerance, the need to spend
   increasing amounts of time engaged in GAME; loss of control,
   unsuccessful attempts to control participation in GAME; Give up other
   activities, loss of interest in previous hobbies and entertainment as a
   result of, and with the exception of, internet GAME; continuation,
   continued excessive gaming despite knowledge of psychosocial problems;
   deception, deceiving family members, therapists, or others regarding
   the quantity of gaming; escape, the use of GAME to avoid or relieve
   negative moods; and negative consequences, risking or losing an
   important relationship, job or education or career opportunity due to
   participation in GAME. Five of the nine criteria must be met within a
   year to be diagnosed as IGD (1). However, APA indicated that further
   clinical experience and research was needed before inclusion of IGD as
   a formal disorder (1).

   In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) included Gaming Disorder
   (GD) in the 11th revision of the International Classification of
   Diseases (ICD 11) (2). According to ICD-11 a patient must exhibit three
   symptoms (impaired control, increasing priority given to gaming,
   continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative
   consequences) to be officially diagnosed with GD (2). Consequently, the
   criteria withdrawal and tolerance which concerns rather biological
   consequences is excluded from the ICD-11 GD diagnosis criteria.

   There is no consensus regarding which rating scales should be used for
   diagnosing disordered gaming and different scales are used both in
   research and in clinical practice. Most studies have used the criteria
   for pathological gambling to define the pathological gaming (3, 4).
   Different researchers have used different cutoffs of the criteria to
   establish a diagnosis (5–8), others have focused strictly on online
   GAME (9), and some researchers have adopted their own criteria for
   disordered gaming (10, 11). One of the most frequently used
   questionnaires for disordered gaming in adolescents is the GASA (GAME
   Addiction Scale for Adolescents) (12–16). GASA was developed
   specifically for adolescents. The items in the GASA relate to homework
   and relationship to parents, designed to correspond to the
   developmental stage of an adolescent (15). The adult version of the
   GASA; GAME Addiction Scale (GAS) has been showed to provide both good
   reliability and validity and in a review of different instruments
   assessing disordered gaming King et al., found that GAS was one of two
   scales that provided the best clinical information for the diagnosis of
   disordered gaming (16). King et al. reviewed 32 different scales and
   found that GAS was one out of five tools that had greater evidential
   support regarding psychometric properties (16). Finserås et al.
   verified this finding in their evaluation of the adolescent version of
   the scale (GASA) in relationship to the nine criteria for disordered
   gaming suggested by the APA (17). In 2019 Donati et al. developed and
   evaluated a Video-Gaming-Scale—For Children (VGS-C), aiming to assess
   pathological gaming behavior in children specifically (18). The GASA
   has the advantage of being a well-established and well-proven
   assessment of disordered gaming (12–17). However, the scale has to our
   knowledge not yet been evaluated in a child and adolescent sample.

   GASA was theoretically based on seven of the DSM-5 criteria for
   pathological gambling: salience (exaggerated preoccupation in thoughts
   and habits), tolerance, mood modification, withdrawal, relapse,
   conflicts, and problems (15). When diagnosing pathological gamblers,
   the DSM-5 requires at least half of their criteria to be met while
   scholars in the gaming research field prefer a ranking of the criteria,
   which they call “the core approach” (1, 5, 12–14, 19). These scholars
   believe that the criteria for tolerance, mood modification and
   cognitive salience are associated with engagement and not necessarily
   with addiction while the contrary is true for the criteria for
   withdrawal, relapse, conflicts and problems (5, 13, 14). The core
   approach thus distinguishes engaged gamers from problem- and addicted
   gamers by emphasizing the “core criteria” namely, withdrawal, relapse,
   conflict and problems in order to yield a more precise and relevant
   estimate of prevalence whereby a diagnosis of GAME addiction should be
   related to comorbidity and interference rather than high engagement
   (13, 14, 17, 20).

   The psychometric properties of GAS have been tested among adult men in
   Switzerland showing satisfactory internal consistency (21), and in a
   population of Iranian adolescents supporting the measurement invariance
   also across gender (22). Brunborg et al. evaluated the core approach
   using a confirmatory factor analysis showing that a two-factor
   structure (peripheral criteria separated from core criteria) fitted
   their data better than the original one-factor structure. The same
   applied for groups of men and women, both aged 16–33 years and for
   those aged 34–74 years (13). However, when Brunborg et al. evaluated
   the two-factor solution no evidence was found for metric invariance,
   implicating that comparison between different subpopulations should be
   done with caution (13). Charlton and Danford contributed with an
   influential distinction between peripheral and core symptomatology in
   terms of gaming, early in the field of gaming research. Consistent with
   the Brunborg et al. research they considered cognitive salience,
   tolerance, and mood modification as a peripheral group of symptoms,
   though with a potential to develop into disordered gaming in certain
   circumstances (5, 19). Concordantly, they suggested an existence of a
   developmental process whereby the peripheral criteria precede the core
   criteria (5).

   Jonsson et al. evaluated a self-test, GamTest, for online gambling,
   largely similar to GASA. These researchers identified two main
   components of early signs of problematic gambling: over consumption
   (OC) and negative consequences (NC) (23). The peripheral criteria
   correspond to over consumption and the core criteria to the negative
   consequences. The negative consequences items where further divided
   conceptually into a social and an emotional part, corresponding to the
   dimensions in GamTest (23). The application of this psycho-social model
   specification enables an exploration of over consumption as an
   explanatory variable for problematic use of GAME rather than just
   charting peripheral components, in accordance with the Charlton and
   Danford suggestion that the peripheral criteria might precede the core
   criteria (5, 23).

   International studies have found the prevalence of disordered gaming to
   range between 1.3 and 6.8 percent (24). Stevens et al. report that the
   prevalence of disordered gaming worldwide in a meta-analysis is 3.05
   percent (25). The differences in prevalence are likely due to
   differences in assessment methods, sample characteristics, and cultures
   in different countries (24, 26). Child and adolescent psychiatrists as
   well as school health care workers have reported disordered gaming
   among their patients and students. These clinicians describe
   compulsion, psychiatric and physical symptoms and impaired school
   performance as components of the disorder (27, 28). Most research on
   disordered gaming reports that males are more likely than females to
   experience disordered gaming (25, 27, 29–31) and the prevalence rates
   are commonly higher in adolescent samples (24, 25). Several previous
   studies report on the association between ADHD and disordered gaming
   (29, 32, 33) and DSM-5 lists ADHD as a comorbidity of IGD (1).
   Stavropoulos et al. presented a theory on gender dependent ADHD
   characteristics as a possible explanation to the gender discrepancy
   regarding disordered gaming (29). However, sex differences in gaming
   and potential gender specific health correlates are poorly understood.

   In summary, the GASA is an established measure of gaming behavior, but
   the psychometric properties of the scale have previously mainly been
   investigated in adult or adolescent populations (16, 24, 25). Male
   gender and ADHD are frequently reported as risk factors for disordered
   gaming (24, 25, 29, 32, 33) but no previous research has to our
   knowledge evaluated how these factors relate to the components in GASA.
   This study contributes to the knowledge of gaming, using a clinical
   sample of children and adolescents to explore the psychosocial
   dimensions of the GASA.

   The present study evaluates the indicators of gaming behavior in GASA
   from a multifactorial perspective and explores the gender differences
   in a clinical setting, focusing on ADHD. Both the two-factor core
   approach and an alternative three-factor version are analyzed
   psychometrically. The study aims are specified as follows:

   1. Explore the dimensionality of the items in GASA and the potential
   impact of gender and/or ADHD.

   2. Analyze the fitting of the two-factor core approach on the CAP
   sample.

   3. Analyze the fitting of an adapted three-factor version of the core
   approach on the CAP sample, by dividing the core items into social and
   emotional categories.

Methods

Participants

   The study was performed in Skane, a county in the south of Sweden with
   1.36 million inhabitants, of which 280,000 are individuals under 18
   years of age. In 2018 CAP Skane had 55,000 unique visits. There are
   seven out-patient child and adolescent psychiatry units in Skane and
   one in-patient unit. The out-patient units cater for all types of child
   and adolescent diagnoses but have no assignment to either diagnose or
   treat addiction problems. In the present study, patients coming to the
   Child and Adolescent Psychiatry clinic (in- and out-patient
   departments, respectively) in Skane during the study period of 4 months
   (Feb–May) during 2020 were asked to participate. Clinicians
   (psychologists, psychiatrists) were systematically provided with
   questionnaires and were asked to distribute these to their patients.
   The study was approved by the Ethics committee (Dnr: 2019-02967).
   Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and their
   parents/guardians.

   The survey was answered by 144 children and adolescents between 8 and
   18 years of age. Six individuals participated without sharing social
   security number which made the collecting of other information (gender,
   age, diagnosis) impossible. One individual abstained from answering the
   GASA-items. Concordantly, seven individuals were excluded from the data
   file leaving 137 individuals, characteristics specified in Table 1. The
   gender distribution was even, most of the participants were recruited
   through outpatient care and a majority were older than 13 years. The
   mean age was 14.5 years. The participant's main as well as secondary
   diagnosis, when applicable, was registered. The diagnoses were referred
   to as the Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, describes them (1).
   ADHD was the most prevalent diagnosis. Other diagnoses that occurred
   were depression, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, eating disorder,
   anxiety/depression, bipolar disease, obsessive compulsive disorder,
   social phobia, and psychosis. All patients were assessed in clinical
   settings by trained psychologists and child and adolescent
   psychiatrists.

   Table 1. Descriptive statistics for CAP sample, n = 137.

   Concerning sample size for the GASA analyses, the Price guidelines are
   for a minimum sample size equal to 105 (7 items × 15 patients) (34).
   The CAP sample includes n = 137 observations and accordingly fulfills
   the requirements according to guidelines (34).

Measures

   One of the most used questionnaires for disordered gaming in
   adolescents is GASA (GAME Addiction Scale for Adolescents), constructed
   by Lemmens et al. (13–17). The seven-item GASA applies to gaming
   behavior in the last 6 months, see Table 2. Each item concerns one
   criterion, answered on a five-point scale: 1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 =
   sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = very often and should be considered endorsed
   when rated 3 or higher (15).
   TABLE 2
   www.frontiersin.org

   Table 2. GASA, peripheral and core items corresponding to OC and NC,
   respectively.

   With support from previous research, empirical data and theoretical
   reasoning (5, 13–15, 19, 23, 35, 36) the GASA items were associated
   with the different factors in a psycho-social conceptual model to
   enable testing of a two-factor approach (core approach) and a
   three-factor approach, in which the peripheral items/negative
   consequences were differentiated into negative consequences social and
   negative consequences emotional, see Table 2. The psychosocial
   conceptual model is guiding the specification of measurement and
   structural models analyzed. For details see Supplementary Diagram 1 and
   paragraph 3 (conceptual model) and 4 (GASA instrument) in the
   electronic supplement. This model specification aims to consider over
   consumption as an explanatory variable for problematic use of GAME
   rather than a peripheral component.

   The following variables were obtained from subjects in the study: GASA,
   gender, age, housing situation (with whom you live), type of care given
   at CAP (in-/out-patient care) and diagnosis at CAP.

Statistical Analysis

   Psychometric analyses including confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were
   used to identify constructs captured by the GASA items through
   well-fitting measurement models. These analyses were performed within
   the latent variable framework in Mplus software Version 8.6 (30).
   Robust maximum-likelihood estimation MLR was applied to adjust for
   skewed item distributions in the goodness-of-fit testing. Item analysis
   and trimming of skewed item distributions was performed to improve the
   fulfillment of the requirements of the chi square testing in the CFA
   and SEM analyses Gender differences in GASA measurement models were
   assessed using multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA). In
   order to explore if the latent variables were equivalent across groups,
   test for invariance in measurements were executed for group comparisons
   of CFA models. Factor analysis of multiple groups considers three
   degrees of measurement invariance: configural, metric (also referred to
   as weak factorial invariance) and scalar (strong factorial invariance).
   In the present study, a two-group two factor metric model corresponding
   to the core approach shows acceptable fit. This measurement model with
   equality constraints for corresponding measurement models (metric
   invariance) across gender was used as the outcome variable in a
   multiple-group structural equation model (SEM) to examine gender
   differences exploring direct and indirect effects of a diagnosis of
   ADHD on over consumption and negative consequences social and emotional
   (34). Details are available in the electronic supplement.

   Goodness of Fit Indexes were calculated for the One- Two- and Three
   factor Solutions to the GASA Scale, for the whole sample (n = 137) and
   divided according to gender (male n = 69, female n = 68), with metric
   invariance, with and without equality constraints. Ever being diagnosed
   with ADHD was added as a covariate independent variable, hereafter
   mentioned as ADHD lifetime. The goodness-of-fit of the CFA/SEM models
   was assessed using the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)
   and the comparative fit index (CFI). Values above 0.95 (CFI) and below
   0.08 (RMSEA) were considered acceptable (37, 38).

   A three-factor model in which negative consequences was differentiated
   into social and emotional harm was explored regarding the impact of
   over consumption.

   This measurement model (3.1 gm) was used as a vehicle to test gender
   differences exploring direct and indirect effects of the risk factor
   diagnose ADHD lifetime on over consumption and negative consequences
   social and negative consequences emotional (Model 3.2 gdia).This model
   assumed equality constraints for corresponding measurement models, see
   Table 3.
   TABLE 3
   www.frontiersin.org

   Table 3. Goodness of fit Indexes for the one-, two- and three-factor
   solutions of GASA.

   Factor scores and means optimized for measurement non-invariance across
   gender were computed with the alignment procedure in Mplus based on a
   one-factor model fitted to over consumption items and negative
   consequences items separately (39). Factor scores and means in an

Results

Overview of Goodness of Fit Results for GASA CFA and SEM Models

   Model fitting results are reported in Table 3. The Goodness of Fit
   Indexes for models including all 7 items, the one-factor model (model
   1.2) and the two-factor model/core approach (Model 2.1), showed a good
   model fit. The Goodness of Fit index for the two-factor model did not
   meet the cutoff values when the sample was divided by gender. When
   correlation errors between item 5 and 7 and equality constraints were
   added the adjusted two-factor model showed an acceptable fit. The
   three-factor model (model 3.1) showed a good fit for the whole sample
   and when divided by gender and when being diagnosed with ADHD lifetime
   was added as a covariate diagnose.

The Psychometric Model for the Core Approach

   Path Diagram for the two-factor CFA model, peripheral-core approach is
   reported in Figure 1. The peripheral items correspond to over
   consumption (OC) and the core items reflect negative consequences (NC).
   In the measurement Model 2.1 (Figure 1) the estimate of the correlation
   between f (OC) and f (NC) was high, 0.91. The model showed an
   acceptable fit (CFI = 0.973; RMSEA = 0.065) which confirmed that the
   core approach shows a valid factor structure for the total sample n =
   137 (see Figure 1; Table 3).

   OC/Peripheral and NC/Core. OC, over consumption; NC, negative
   consequences.

   The two-factor model (core approach) divided by gender showed a CFI
   value just below 0.95. When inserting the correlation between error
   terms for item 5 (withdrawal) and 7 (neglect duties) in Model 2.1 g
   (the negative consequences emotional factor) the goodness of fit was
   improved, see Figure 2 and Table 3. The correlation between OC and NC
   latent variables was 0.89 for girls and 0.97 for boys.

The Three-Factor Model

   The three-factor model showed an acceptable fit (CFI = 0.974; RMSEA =
   0.069) which confirms that this alternative version of the core
   approach constitutes a valid factor structure for the total sample n =
   137. The factor structure remained valid when analyzed with a two-group
   model with equality constraints across gender groups for corresponding
   measurement models (see Table 3; Figure 3).

   NC emotional (not represenated in the path diagram) for males is 0.40
   and for females 0.87. OC, over consumption; NC, negative consequences.

   Residual correlations of NC social with NC emotional (not represented
   in the path diagram) for males was 0.40 and for females 0.87. When the
   path coefficient for OC → NC was differentiated into a social and
   emotional path coefficient, the strongest relationship for boys
   appeared as OC → NC social equal to 0.89 and for girls OC → NC
   emotional equal to 0.95.

Gender Differences in the Three-Factor Model With Covariate ADHD

   When the risk factor being diagnosed with ADHD was added as a covariate
   the estimated path coefficient showed that ADHD constituted a
   significant correlate for both over consumption of gaming and negative
   consequences specified as social for females but not for males, see
   Figure 4.

The Impact of Age and ADHD on Differences in Gaming Behavior for Boys and for
Girls

   The new aligned T-scores measure severity of over consumption and
   negative consequences at a common scale. Minor and non-significant
   differences appeared between the child and teenage groups concerning
   their gaming severity, both regarding over consumption and negative
   consequences, among both male and female participants. The effect of
   age is illustrated in Figure 5 and further described in ANOVA tests
   reported in Supplementary Table 8 and through descriptive statistics in
   Supplementary Table 9 in the electronic supplement. The female
   participants show a significant difference between ADHD lifetime and
   other diagnoses both for over consumption (mean 100 vs. 60, p = 0.01)
   and for negative consequences (mean 93 vs. 67, p = 0.03) while male's
   mean profiles are very close and non-significant but at a higher level
   compared with the females. The interaction effect is illustrated in
   Figure 6 and further described in ANOVA tests reported in Supplementary
   Table 5 and through descriptive statistics in Supplementary Table 6 in
   the electronic supplement.

Discussion

   The present study contributes to our understanding of the
   dimensionality of GASA but also presents results that indicate a gender
   dependent distinction regarding the negative consequences of over
   consumption of gaming. The two-factor model of the core approach showed
   a satisfactory fit to the data. The three-factor version of the core
   approach also showed a good fit, when differentiating the negative
   consequences core items into social and emotional consequences.
   Interestingly, our findings suggest that over consumption of video
   GAME is more heavily associated with negative consequences for male
   gamers but also that their negative consequences of over consumption
   tend to be social rather than emotional, as was the case for female
   gamers. ADHD was significantly associated with over consumption of
   video GAME and the negative consequences thereof for girls. The male
   participants over consumed GAME to a higher degree than the females
   and showed more severe consequences, regardless of a potential ADHD
   diagnosis.

   The fact that the three-factor model showed a good fit to the data
   confirms that the division of negative consequences into negative
   consequences social and negative consequences emotional could be a
   valid alternative factor structure. However, these constructs only
   contain two items each, making the social and emotional dimensions
   insufficiently grounded for reliable factor scores. Three items with
   high loadings are required to establish a solid factor (34). This
   suggests that further development of GASA is needed in order to capture
   both social and emotional components.

   Most research agree that male gender is a risk factor for disordered
   gaming (25, 27, 30). Boys in general tend to spend more time on gaming
   and they are overrepresented among the minority that exhibits gaming
   problems (27, 30). Time spent on gaming has been reported as a risk
   factor for disordered gaming (30, 40) but whether the time spent
   constitute a greater risk for boys than for girls remains unclear. Our
   findings suggest that the association between over consumption of GAME
   and negative consequences thereof is stronger for boys. Further, our
   results suggest that the negative consequences of over consumption take
   a social direction for boys and an emotional direction for girls, a
   distinction that warrant additional investigation. Bonnaire et al.
   investigated gender differences in disordered gaming and showed that
   male gamers were disproportionately more likely to be single than
   female gamers whereas the female gamers showed a higher anxiety score
   (31). Possibly, the results presented by Bonnaire et al. (31) supports
   the tendency shown in this study using the three-factor structure of
   GASA, illuminating gender distinctive emotional and social consequences
   of gaming. GASA could be further developed with complementary items on
   social as well as emotional aspects of gaming in order to determine and
   further explore a potential psychosocial gender discrepancy of
   disordered gaming. In the 15-item gambling Gam Test the emotional
   factor was measured with 5 items, including aspects such as; feeling
   bad when thinking about gambling, gambling resulting in feelings of
   irritation and “I do not want to tell other people about how much time
   and money I spend on my gambling” (23). Similar items, adapted to
   gaming and to young individuals, could theoretically be added to the
   GASA to strengthen the factors of both the emotional and social
   dimensions.

   ADHD is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in
   childhood with an estimated prevalence of 5 per cent, globally (41,
   42). It is a heterogeneous condition with persistent symptoms of
   hyperactivity, inattention and impulsiveness that impair functioning in
   multiple settings (1). Researchers have found that ADHD is a particular
   risk factor for disordered gaming (32, 33, 43–46). In the current CAP
   sample, ADHD was significantly associated with over consumption of
   video GAME and the negative consequences thereof for girls, an
   association that was not seen among the male participants. Possibly,
   our results could be interpreted as being diagnosed with ADHD increases
   the risk of over consumption of computer GAME and the negative
   consequences thereof more for girls than for boys. To our knowledge,
   this gender discrepancy has not previously been explored. However,
   consistent with our findings, Yen et al. showed that the association
   between ADHD and Internet addiction was greater among female than male
   college students (32). Somewhat contractionary to our findings,
   Stavropoulos et al. hypothesized that the fact that female ADHD
   predominantly demonstrates inattention while males rather experience
   hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms could contribute to a gender
   discrepancy regarding disordered gaming (29). They further hypothesized
   that hyperactivity-impulsivity mediates a greater risk for disordered
   gaming, which they managed to demonstrate, in consistency with other
   research (29, 47). However, Stavropoulos et al., did neither
   investigate whether ADHD is associated with a greater increase in risk
   for disordered gaming for either boys or girls nor did they define
   whether female gender affected the impact of
   hyperactivity-impulsivity/inattention. Martins et al., who investigated
   gender differences in mental health characteristics among adolescent
   gamblers, showed that parents to female gamblers were disproportionally
   likely to rate high levels of childhood hyperactivity when compared to
   parents to male gamblers (48). Since both gaming and gambling are more
   common and socially accepted behaviors among men, it is possible that
   women are more prone to exhibit predisposing conditions. Regardless,
   our findings warrant additional research to establish and explain a
   potential gender discrepancy regarding the association between ADHD and
   disordered gaming.

Strengths

   The study provides an interdisciplinary perspective on diagnostic
   testing and applies a psychometric methodology capable of uncovering
   different aspects of gaming behavior in a clinical setting (49).
   Specifically, the statistical analyses take measurement errors in
   criteria as well as sample size into account. Alternative measurement
   models are tested for goodness-of-fit, including test for invariance
   across gender groups (34). In summary, the methodology is grounding the
   results in qualified empirical evidence.

Limitations

   The present study does have some limitations. One limitation is the
   cross-sectional design which does not allow for conclusions regarding
   cause and effect. In order to explore causation a longitudinal
   investigation is required. Further, the measures used for this study
   are partly based on self-reporting, which implies a risk for recall
   bias. One other limitation is a possible selection bias. Clinicians
   were provided with questionnaires and were supposed to distribute them
   to their patients, but the study design does not provide any insight
   into the numbers of patients declining or more importantly why.
   However, the gender distribution was even, ADHD was the most prevalent
   disorder, as expected (41, 42) and we have no obvious reason to believe
   that the sample excelled heavily from an ordinary CAP population. The
   different specifications of alternative models relating over
   consumption with negative consequences show that the relationship is
   remarkably high, with correlations as high as 0.97, possible reflecting
   a weakness in the self-test of a strong general method factor present
   as part of both over consumption and negative consequences. Among
   issues in the design of GASA and in data collection causing bias in the
   correlation between over consumption and negative consequences through
   such a factor, is low motivation for youth to engage in answering
   questionnaires (50). Furthermore, GASA was originally developed based
   on the DSM-5 criteria for pathological gambling (15). Disordered gaming
   behavior among youth may involve other issues than those involved in
   gambling among adults.

Conclusion

   The psychometric approach differentiates information gathered using
   established diagnostic instruments like GASA into measures of behavior
   lying underneath the different markers/diagnostic criteria. Available
   diagnostic instruments could be strengthened by complementary items
   designed for children and youth in order to illuminate the complexity
   of gaming behavior. Our results suggest that the association between
   over consumption of GAME and negative consequences thereof is stronger
   for boys than for girls. Negative consequences of over consumption take
   a social direction for boys and an emotional direction for girls. ADHD
   was significantly associated with over consumption of video GAME and
   the negative consequences thereof for girls, an association that was
   not seen among the male participants. Together, our findings should
   encourage further developments of the GASA instrument and additional
   research on potential gender related discrepancies of disordered
   gaming.

A Brief History of GAME

   Human history and GAME are inextricably intertwined. Irrefutable
   evidence resounds down through the ages that fun and GAME are not
   frivolous pursuits per se—instead, they come naturally to us as
   essential parts of being alive. When you understand the evolution of
   GAME, you can begin to make intelligent choices about what elements of
   GAME you might want to include in your gamification designs.

A Dim and Distant Past

   Have you ever been to the zoo? If so, you’ll most likely have sat and
   watched monkeys and apes for a while. It doesn’t take very much to see
   them at play. They’ll chase each other, throw things, jump on each
   other, and that kind of thing. Assuming, as seems likely, that human
   beings are just better evolved monkeys, it’s likely that we’ve been
   playing GAME for a long, long time. We were probably playing GAME
   before we learned to speak or even to stand on two legs.

   That means we have no idea what the first GAME we played were like.
   However, we do have a good idea of the timeline of modern GAME
   development.

Rolling the Dice 3,000 Years Ago

   Dice aren’t a modern invention. In fact, they’re probably among the
   oldest known gaming tools known to man. During an excavation in
   Southeastern Iran, archeologists discovered a 3,000-year-old set of
   dice! We don’t know exactly what GAME those early Persians would have
   played with them, but the popularity of dice has endured throughout the
   centuries.

   Dice GAME have been with mankind for a very long time, as you can see
   from this cave painting.

   ©WolfgangRieger, Fair Use

   In 14th-century England, people were playing a GAME called Hazard (it’s
   mentioned in that famous work The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey
   Chaucer), and Hazard didn’t fall out of favour until the 19th century.
   It had a very complex rule set and has since been supplanted by dice
   GAME with simpler rules.

     “Take a simple idea and take it seriously.”
     —Charlie Munger, American investor, businessman, lawyer and
     philanthropist

   Whether carved in bone or cast in plastic, the simplicity of a die—a
   cube with dots and nothing more—as an effective, if chancy, determinant
   is ageless. You may not know this, but the most popular GAME in casinos
   would remain—well into the 21st century—a dice GAME. Craps is the only
   GAME in a gambling house where the odds are in favour of the gambler.
   Despite this, it’s the most profitable GAME for the casinos; people
   don’t seem to know just when to stop playing. And play they
   do—elsewhere, too, using dice in a range of fun-filled activities that
   have been extending into less adult settings, such as homes and
   schools, through the years. Yahtzee revolves around dice, and not for
   nothing does Dungeons &amp Dragons incorporate dice, even if many of those
   dice have 4, 10, 12, 20 or even more faces.

Tiles and Dominoes

   There are references to tile GAME in China that are over 2,900 years
   old. Dominoes emerged 1,000 years later during the Song Dynasty (also
   in China). However, Western dominoes probably only began in the 18th
   century, and Mahjong (the most popular tile GAME in the world – it’s of
   Chinese origin) didn’t arrive until the 19th century.

Board GAME are Even Older

   If you enjoy a GAME of Monopoly or Scrabble, it would appear that you
   are in good company. The earliest known board GAME are 5,000 years old
   and were played by the Egyptians. We don’t know the rules of these
   GAME, but there is a “Senet” board that dates back to about 3500 B.C.!

   The Chinese invented their first known board GAME in 200 B.C., and, in
   Western Europe, they were playing Tafl (a GAME very similar to chess)
   from 400 B.C.

   Chess is often considered to be the “archetypal” board GAME and is
   itself very old, but there were board GAME well prior to the invention
   of chess.

Still Playing!

   If you’ve ever played Go, Chess, Backgammon or Nine Men’s Morris, then
   you’ve played a GAME with more than a thousand years of history! Go is
   from 200 B.C. in Korea, Backgammon from Iran around 600 A.D. (complete
   with dice), Chess from India around the same time and Nine Men’s Morris
   may be from Mediaeval England, but many think it stems from the Roman
   Empire!

   Snakes and Ladders, one of the world’s most popular children’s GAME
   probably began in India in the 16th century. And, surprise, surprise,
   dice power the probability for players in that GAME, too.

   The first commercial board GAME arrived in the year 1800 and was
   produced by George Fox in England. It was called the Mansion of
   Happiness and was essentially a “race GAME” similar to Ludo. The oldest
   surviving board GAME company is Milton Bradley (whose famous GAME
   include; Downfall, Hungry Hippos and Connect 4), who were formed in
   1860!

   The Mansion of Happiness was the very first board GAME to be produced
   commercially (i.e., on an industrial basis).

   © ItsLassieTime, Fair Use

Deal Me In!

   Card GAME are a more recent invention, and the first use of a card
   deck was probably in Ancient China. They would have been played during
   the Tang Dynasty (6th century A.D. – 9th century A.D.). Cards reached
   Europe in the 14th century, and early decks would have been very
   similar to Tarot cards, whose modern and classic mediaeval versions we
   can find online or in virtually any bookstore’s Mind, Body and Spirit
   section.

   The four-suit (hearts, spades, clubs and diamonds) deck that we’re most
   familiar with was invented in France around 1480. The oldest card GAME
   that we still play is probably Cribbage, which came from the 17th
   century. Bridge didn’t arrive until the early 19th century.

   In the 1990s, cards were revisited and GAME like ‘Magic! The
   Gathering’ were introduced and became incredibly popular. Card GAME
   would also extend to trumps—a classic favourite in British schools,
   featuring items from racing cars to spacecraft, Western gunfighters and
   horror monsters, in which players compare the statistics of their
   topmost cards, and win or lose accordingly.

Table GAME

   Carom, is possibly the oldest table GAME (it’s very similar to
   tiddlywinks or shuffleboard), but no-one knows exactly when or where it
   came into existence. Pool, billiards and snooker are all relatively
   recent inventions, and roulette only arrived in the 19th century.

   The GAME pictured above, may look (at first glance) like pool, but it’s
   actually a modern billiards table—as you can see by the lack of pockets
   on the table.

You’re in Good Company

   As you can see, GAME have a long rich history, and whenever you decide
   to play a GAME, you’re in good company. Human beings have been playing
   GAME throughout the centuries. They are part of the human experience.

What about Electronic GAME?

   You may be surprised to find that the first electronic GAME was
   invented in the United States before the computer! A patent was filed
   back in 1947 for a “Cathode ray tube amusement device”. In the 1950s,
   also in the United States, (very few) people began playing computer
   GAME on mainframe systems – these would have been out of reach for the
   vast majority of people as the hardware would have been astronomically
   expensive.

   The first GAME console was the Magnavox Odyssey – released in 1972.
   Arcade GAME such as Space Invaders, Pacman, etc. began life in 1978
   and became hugely popular into the early 1980s. During that time, quite
   a few consoles were released, but a crash in the American gaming
   industry killed off most of the companies involved in 1983. When the
   Japanese picked up the reins and began developing video GAME, console
   gaming became universally popular, signalling the slow downfall of the
   arcade GAME.

     “Everyone has played video GAME at some point these days, and video
     GAME are fun.”
     —PewDiePie, Swedish comedian and web producer

   GAME have a long history, as you can see, and the electronic GAME’s
   roots stretch right back to the earliest of human GAME. It’s not that
   our ancestors needed to tell us that GAME go with the territory of
   being alive; GAME are hardwired into our DNA.

The Take Away

   Human history and GAME are inextricably intertwined. For millennia,
   people have held an innate compulsion to play, and that won’t change
   anytime soon. What they needed, they innovated, leaving us a wealthy
   legacy of devices through the centuries, ranging from the basic but
   powerful wonder of dice, to the timeless strategising involved in
   chess, and on up to a library of latter-day board GAME that run the
   gamut in their levels of sophistication. As long as you’ve got an
   understanding the evolution of GAME, you can begin to make intelligent
   choices about what elements of GAME you might want to include in your
   gamification designs.

The Most Popular School Playground GAME

   Children play many classic outdoor GAME on school playgrounds, many of
   which have been played for generations, and some are new for this
   generation of youngsters. Kids love playing, whether it’s during
   recess, after school, on the weekend or all summer long.

   There are some GAME kids often play on playground equipment, whether
   it’s making believe they’re in a castle or mountain climbing. Kids have
   such active imaginations, though, that they can play GAME even when
   there’s nothing but asphalt, blacktop or a sidewalk to play on.

   Academic studies are certainly important, but playing GAME at school
   is just as helpful for growth and learning. GAME help kids stay in
   shape, develop their creative abilities and build social skills — what
   could be better?

Top GAME To Play On A School Playground For Kids in the United States

   It would be impossible to list all the different types of children’s
   playground GAME, especially when you consider all the children’s GAME
   worldwide. The following list, however, includes many simple and
   classic outdoor playground GAME that children have played in
   schoolyards for generations:

Young girl playing dodgeball Young girl playing dodgeball

1. Dodge Ball

   Dodge Ball is a great GAME to get students active. Two evenly-numbered
   teams line up their dodgeballs in the middle of a court and retreat to
   each end. On the signal, they rush to the center to grab a ball and
   throw it at opposing players, eliminating them from the GAME. The team
   that eliminates all players from the other team wins the GAME.

2. Double Dutch

   A popular jump rope GAME, Double Dutch, requires at least three people.
   Two players swing jump ropes in opposite directions, while the third
   player jumps between them without disrupting them. Players often chant
   or sing a rhyme to help time the jumps. This is a great GAME to teach
   kids to coordinate with others.

3. Heads Up Seven Up

   Heads Up Seven Up is a classic classroom GAME in which seven “choosers”
   make their way around a group of players who have their heads down and
   one thumb raised. Each chooser taps one thumb, and the players try to
   guess who touched their thumb. If they guess correctly, they swap
   places with their chooser.

4. Hopscotch

   An excellent way for children to improve their balance and hand-eye
   coordination, hopscotch involves a series of numbered squares drawn in
   a grid on the pavement. Children must throw an object into one of the
   squares and retrieve it using a sequence of hops without touching the
   lines.

5. I Spy

   One player chooses an object and says, “I spy with my little eye,”
   giving a description of the item like its color. Players take turns
   guessing what the item is. Use this GAME to help students develop their
   investigative skills.

6. Jacks

Jack Playground GAME Jack Playground GAME

   Another great GAME to play on the playground is jacks. Players need
   jacks and a small rubber ball for jacks. Players bounce the ball on the
   ground and catch a set number of jacks in the opposite hand,
   progressing until they make a mistake, at which point their opponent
   takes a turn. The first player to progress through the series of throws
   and catches wins.

7. Jump Rope

   A good GAME for a single child or a team, jump rope has nearly endless
   variations. Players swing and jump over a rope, seeing how many jumps
   they can make without touching it.

8. Kickball

   Kickball is one of the most popular outdoor GAME for kids. The GAME is
   similar to baseball, except players kick a dodge ball instead of
   swinging a bat.

9. Red Rover

   Two teams line up and link arms to form a chain. Players take turns
   calling over a player from the other group using the “Red Rover” chant.
   That player must break the chain or join the team.

10. Mother, May I

   The player designated as Mother stands with their back to the rest, who
   request to take various movements, like two crabwalk steps or five
   hops, toward Mother. Mother grants them permission, or not, until they
   are tagged.

11. Red Light, Green Light

   Red Light, Green Light is a great way to teach students about following
   directions. One player is “it” and faces away from the rest of the
   players lined up several yards down the field. When the player who is
   “it” shouts “green light,” the others move toward them and try to tag
   them. However, the player who is “it” can also yell “red light” when
   they turn toward the other players. If they catch another player moving
   on a “red light,” the player is eliminated.

12. Hot Potato

   Don’t have a hot potato on hand? No problem! Students can play hot
   potato on the playground with a ball or soft object. Students stand in
   a circle and pass the ball. If they drop it, they are out. The GAME
   continues until there is only one player standing.

   If you have access to music, you can play the music and pause it at
   various intervals. In this case, the person holding the ball when the
   music stops is also out.

13. Charades

   Charades is an excellent way for kids to use their imagination. To make
   gameplay simple, you will need 2 small containers and some paper
   scraps.

   To play, divide your students into 2 teams. Ask each student to write a
   word or phrase on a scrap of paper and place it in the other team’s
   bowl. You can boost the education factor by incorporating characters
   from class readings or vocabulary words. Then, allow one player at a
   time to draw a paper from their team’s bowl and attempt to act out the
   phrase using hand signals and body motions. No speaking aloud! The team
   that guesses the most terms correctly wins!

The Benefits of Kids GAME

   With childhood obesity rising in America, active GAME are particularly
   important for kids to play. Activities that utilize playground
   equipment, jump ropes or other body movements help get kids moving.
   When kids are inactive during their recesses at school and spend their
   free time at home playing video GAME and watching TV instead of going
   outside, they are developing behaviors that could hold them back for
   the rest of their lives.

   GAME that rely on children’s brains and encourage teamwork are equally
   beneficial because they help to strengthen mental and social
   skills that will come in handy as they enter middle school, high
   school, college and the job market. The GAME that kids play on the
   school and park playground offer many benefits, whether they’re
   creative GAME that use their imagination or active GAME that work out
   their body. Children should be encouraged to play these simple
   playground GAME as much as possible.

Small GAME Hunting

   Although there are many opportunities for hunting small GAME in
   Washington, small GAME hunting is not nearly as popular as big GAME
   hunting. Often, hunters pursue small GAME while they are hunting other
   species. Popular small GAME animals include bobcats, raccoons, rabbits
   and hares, foxes, and coyotes. Small GAME animals are found in all
   areas that offer suitable habitats. Hunting methods and techniques
   vary, depending upon hunter skill and knowledge.

   A hunting license is required to hunt all small GAME species. Some
   species, such as coyote, may be hunted year round with few exceptions.
   Other species, such as cottontails and raccoons, may be hunted only
   during established seasons.

License Information

   The small GAME license in Washington State allows the holder to hunt
   for wild animals and wild birds except big GAME. There are additional
   charges for turkey tags, western Washington pheasant permits, and
   migratory bird validations.

10 GAME you can play with your cat

   Share

   [shutterstock_613963637.jpg]

   Want to spend more quality time with your cat and keep their mind
   sharp? Look no further, we’ll give you the low-down right here.

   Cats generally sleep for a large amount of the day so it’s important
   you keep your feline friend active when you can. The first step in
   ensuring a happy and healthy life for your cat is to mentally stimulate
   their brain. Here are some fun, interactive GAME to build a bond and
   keep your furry friend entertained.

   Fetch

   You may be surprised to discover that many cats love to play fetch, or
   chase after the ball you throw. This stimulates the part of their brain
   they would use to catch prey. First, get the attention of your fur baby
   by calling their name and showing them a ball or toy you know they
   love. Toss the chosen object and you should see your cat leaping around
   trying to retrieve it. Call them back and always make sure you have a
   treat to reward their behaviour. They may eventually learn to return
   the ball back to you after some practice.

   Food Play

   Puzzle feeders are a great method to use on your cat as they have a
   desire to hunt and work for their food. Food is naturally motivating,
   so the whole process of receiving food through a puzzle is rewarding
   for your furry friend. Start with a simple puzzle filled with food so
   that the cat doesn’t get frustrated and you can slowly work your way up
   to harder puzzles. This can be done with food dispenser balls or you
   could make your own food puzzle. Shop our naturals range for the
   perfect treats to hide inside.

   Catnip

   Catnip can be used to encourage your cat to behave in a positive manner
   and sometimes reduce their anxiety levels. If your cat needs a bit more
   exercise, add a little catnip to their favourite toys to make playing
   even more interesting. Most cats react to catnip by rolling, flipping
   and rubbing. Use this every so often to make playtime more exciting,
   but don’t go overboard.

   Chasing Prey

   Using a toy on a string and simulating the movements of prey will give
   your cat a fun and interactive play time with their paw-rents. This
   will build a bond between you and your feline, while improving your
   cat’s health with all the jumping and bouncing they will be doing
   attempting to catch their toy. This playtime is sure to tire your cat
   out.

   Hide and seek

   A GAME like hide-and-seek is a useful way to build a bond with your
   cat. You can hide behind a couch, desk, or bed and it is a fantastic
   GAME to play indoors.The goal here is for your cat to playfully stalk
   you, as if you were their prey! Some cats even enjoy the hiding part
   and tuck themselves away somewhere while you look for them.This is a
   good way to connect GAME with excitement and mental stimulation.

   Tablet GAME

   There are so many free GAME to keep your cat amused on your phone or
   tablet. Your cat will be entertained as they attempt to catch their
   digital prey with a variety of moving fish, mice, and other tempting
   graphics like lasers. Watch as your furry friend tries to paw their way
   through the screen.

   Ping Pong

   You and your cat can have a lot of fun with a basic ping pong ball.
   Simply toss the ball against the wall or the floor and see if your cat
   can catch it.Their contortions and twists will make them look like a
   feline acrobat as they try to swipe at the ball.

   Teach them a Trick

   Cat training is a great way to connect with your cat as many cats love
   training if done properly, with patience and rewards. Start with a
   simple ‘sit’ command. With a treat in one hand, let your fur baby have
   a good sniff. Then, enclose the treat into a fist and move your hand to
   your chest while instructing to ‘sit’. Repeat this until your cat has
   got the hang of it, while also remembering to reward them.

   Climbing toys

   Cats enjoy climbing and a multi-tiered scratching post is excellent for
   this. This sort of design gives your cat a sense of security by
   providing hiding spots and a high shelf to see the world go by. To make
   their climbing more interesting, you can hide treats on the tiers of
   their climbing toys and see how fast they can sniff out their rewards.

   Fishing Rod Toy

   These toys are good for active cats and will certainly give them a fun
   play time. First, dangle the fishing rod toy in front of them until you
   get their attention. Your furry friend should rush after it, into
   corners and behind furniture, and even jump to grab it in the air,
   while you quickly move it about, just out of your fur baby’s reach.

   Cats love a variety of GAME and toys so keeping them rotated will
   ensure they never get bored. Giving your cat the nutrients they need is
   important when it comes to generating enough energy to play. Shop our
   Naturals range for the purr-fect treats and main meals.

5 GAME to Play With Your Dog

   Published: 7/17/2017·2-4 minutes· (BUTTON) Share this article
   Dog GAME Dog GAME

   One of the best parts of being a dog owner is finding fun and
   constructive GAME for dogs. Engaging in physically and mentally
   stimulating exercise with your dog is a great way to keep them healthy.
   It also strengthens your bond.

   Whether it’s GAME to play with your dog inside or outside, teaching
   your dog interactive GAME with treats as a reward or discovering
   mental GAME for dogs, there are many ways to keep your dog (and you)
   entertained virtually anywhere

GAME for Dogs

1. Fetch

   Almost every dog gets excited over a GAME of fetch, as it’s a classic
   GAME for humans and dogs alike. All you need is a yard, park or field,
   a tennis ball or frisbee and an enthusiastic dog to have some fun.

   Fetch is an excellent GAME for energetic dogs. It provides plenty of
   physical exercise while helping them fulfill their instinct to run. It
   can also keep your dog mentally engaged and challenged by trying
   different objects for him to run after. For example, a frisbee may be a
   bit trickier to catch yet more fun to snag in midair.

   Try adjusting the height, distance and direction of your throws to keep
   your dog interested. Don’t forget to praise your dog each time they
   return their toy to you so you can toss it one more time.

2. Tug of War

   Another classic GAME most dogs love is playing tug of war. Great for
   both indoor or outdoor play, tug of war is fun and engaging for your
   dog. Plus, all that pulling and tugging is a good source of physical
   exercise. Avoid overexciting your dog with this GAME, and don’t let
   children play this one.

   A few things to keep in mind: be careful if you’re playing tug of war
   with a puppy. Remember, puppies’ mouths have not fully formed, and they
   still have their baby teeth. Only pull gently for a few seconds at a
   time. If they seem too little, explore other play activities.

   Keep your dog’s tooth and gum health in mind when playing tug of war.
   Use something that won’t hurt the insides of their mouth. Try using a
   rope, or a dog toy made from soft rubber. If your dog has a history of
   back and neck injuries, try another activity until talking with your
   veterinarian.

3. Hide the Treat or Hide &amp Seek

   If you’re looking to play mentally stimulating mind GAME for dogs, you
   can’t go wrong with hide the treat. This dog enrichment GAME is a fun
   way for them to exercise their problem-solving skills. Simply leave a
   trail by rubbing the treat on a few spots along the way to its hiding
   space, then place it somewhere that’s challenging for your dog to find.

   As your dog searches, try using language like “hot” and “cold” as your
   dog gets closer and further away from the treat. Changing your tone
   from a calm “cold” to an excited “warm” or “hot” will build their
   listening skills, though it will take some training before they truly
   understand.

4. Chase the Prey

   Unleash your dog’s natural hunting instincts in a positive way that
   won’t result in local squirrels scampering up a tree. This GAME uses a
   flirt pole. A flirt pole is a long pole or stick with a rope attached
   to one end. You can either purchase a flirt pole or make one with a
   little bit of DIY.

   Tie a toy to the rope of the flirt pole and drag it slowly,
   occasionally stopping as your dog gets ready to pounce. Make sure to
   let your dog “catch” the toy periodically as a reward, so they gain
   confidence and don’t lose interest.

5. Agility Training

   If you’re ready to take it to the next level, agility training is the
   way to go. Agility training is the ultimate mental and physical
   stimulation for dogs. It will help your dog burn off excess energy and
   help tire them out for a long nap or a restful night of sleep.

   Set up an obstacle course in a yard or park with objects from around
   the house. You can use boxes to jump over, cones for them to weave
   between and anything else that comes to mind. If you have a hula hoop,
   teach them to jump through it and, of course, reward them with treats
   as they make progress.

Avoid Overstimulation

   There are lots of GAME to play with dogs both inside and outside.
   Having fun with your dog enriches both of your lives but avoid play
   that’s too aggressive or leads to overstimulation.

   Make sure to end your play sessions while you’re both having a good
   time. This leaves your dog excited for their next play session rather
   than exhausted and discouraged.

     Do Video GAME Influence Violent Behavior?

   By:  Roanna Cooper, MA and Marc Zimmerman, PhD, MI-YVPC Director

   An op-ed article appeared recently in the The New York Times
   discussing the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down California’s law
   barring the sale or rental of violent video GAME to people under 18.
   The author, Dr. Cheryl Olson,   describes how the proposed law was
   based on the erroneous assumption that such GAME influence violent
   behavior in real life.

   Dr. Olson suggests that the deliberately outrageous nature of violent
   GAME, though disturbing, makes them easily discernible from real life
   and suggests that the interactivity could potentially make such GAME
   less harmful.

   She raises the question of how these two behaviors can be linked if
   youth violence has declined over the last several years while violent
   video GAME playing has increased significantly during the same period.

   This analysis ignores the fact that such variation may be explained by
   factors other than the link between the two. A spurious variable–a
   third variable that explains the relationship between two other
   variables—may explain the negative correlation of video GAME playing
   and violent behavior. As one example, socioeconomic status may explain
   both a decline in violent behavior and an increase in video GAME
   playing. More affluent youth have the means and time to buy and play
   video GAME, which keeps them safely inside while avoiding potentially
   violent interactions on the street.  Dr. Olsen also cites several
   studies that have failed to show a connection between violent video
   GAME playing and violent behavior among youth.

   This conclusion, however, may not be as clear cut as it appears.

Youth violence remains a significant public health issue

   The decline of youth violence notwithstanding, it remains a significant
   public health issue that requires attention.Youth homicide remains the
   number one cause of death for African-American youth between 14 and 24
   years old, and the number two cause for all children in this age group.
   Furthermore, the proportion of youth admitting to having committed
   various violent acts within the previous 12 months has remained steady
   or even increased somewhat in recent years
   (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/108/5/1222.full.pdf+html
   ).  Although the Columbine tragedy and others like it make the
   headlines, youth are killed everyday by the hands of another.  A more
   critical analysis of the link between video GAME playing and violence
   is necessary for fully understanding a complex problem like youth
   violent behavior that has many causes and correlates.

Studies support a link between violent video GAME and aggressive behavior

   Researchers have reported experimental evidence linking violent video
   GAME to more aggressive behavior, particularly as it relates to
   children who are at more sensitive stages in their socialization.
   These effects have been found to be particularly profound in the case
   of child-initiated virtual violence.
     * In their book, Violent Video GAME Effects on Children and
       Adolescents, Anderson, Gentile, and Buckley provide an in depth
       analysis of three recent studies they conducted  comparing the
       effects of interactive (video GAME) versus passive (television and
       movies) media violence on aggression and violence.
          + In one study, 161 9- to 12-year olds and 354 college students
            were randomly assigned to play either a violent or nonviolent
            video GAME.  The participants subsequently played another
            computer GAME in which they set punishment levels to be
            delivered to another person participating in the study (they
            were not actually administered).  Information was also
            gathered on each participant’s recent history of violent
            behavior; habitual video GAME, television, and move habits,
            and several other control variables.  The authors reported
            three main findings: 1) participants who played one of violent
            video GAME would choose to punish their opponents with
            significantly more high-noise blasts than those who played the
            nonviolent GAME; 2) habitual exposure to violent media was
            associated with higher levels of recent violent behavior; and
            3) interactive forms of media violence were more strongly
            related to violent behavior than exposure to non-interactive
            media violence.
          + The second study was a cross-sectional correlational study of
            media habits, aggression-related individual difference
            variables, and aggressive behaviors of an adolescent
            population.  High school students (N=189) completed surveys
            about their violent TV, movie, and video GAME exposure,
            attitudes towards violence, and perceived norms about violent
            behavior and personality traits.  After statistically
            controlling for sex, total screen time and aggressive beliefs
            and attitudes, the authors found that playing violent video
            GAME predicted heightened physically aggressive behavior and
            violent behavior in the real world in a long-term context.
          + In a third study, Anderson et al. conducted a longitudinal
            study of elementary school students to examine if violent
            video GAME exposure resulted in increases in aggressive
            behavior over time.  Surveys were given to 430 third, fourth,
            and fifth graders, their peers, and their teachers at two
            times during a school year.  The survey assessed both media
            habits and their attitudes about violence.  Results indicated
            that children who played more violent video GAME early in a
            school year changed to see the world in a more aggressive way
            and also changed to become more verbally and physically
            aggressive later in the school year.  Changes in attitude were
            noticed by both peers and teachers.
     * Bushman and Huesmann, in a 2006 Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine
       article, examined effect size estimates using meta-analysis to look
       at the short- and long-term effects of violent media on aggression
       in children and adults.  They reported a positive relationship
       between exposure to media violence and subsequent aggressive
       behavior, aggressive ideas, arousal, and anger across the studies
       they examined.  Consistent with the theory that long-term effects
       require the learning of beliefs and that young minds can easier
       encode new scripts via observational learning, they found that the
       long-term effects were greater for children.
     * In a more recent review, Anderson et al. (2010) also analyzed 136
       studies representing 130,296 participants from several countries.
       These included experimental laboratory work, cross-sectional
       surveys and longitudinal studies.  Overall, they found consistent
       associations between playing violent video GAME and many measures
       of aggression, including self, teacher and parent reports of
       aggressive behavior.  Although the correlations were not high
       (r=0.17-0.20), they are typical for psychological studies in
       general and comparable with other risk factors for youth violence
       suggested in the 2001 Surgeon General’s Report on youth violence.

Violent video GAME may increase precursors to violent behavior, such as
bullying

   Although playing violent video GAME may not necessarily determine
   violent or aggressive behavior, it may increase precursors to violent
   behavior.  In fact, Dr. Olson points out that violent video GAME may
   be related to bullying, which researchers have found to be a risk
   factor for more serious violent behavior. Therefore, video GAME playing
   may have an indirect effect on violent behavior by increasing risk
   factors for it.  Doug Gentile notes that the only way for violent video
   GAME to affect serious criminal violence statistics is if they were
   the primary predictor of crime, which they may not be.  Rather, they
   represent one risk factor among many for aggression
   (http://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/12/virtual-violence.aspx).

Should video GAME be regulated?

   L. Rowell Huesmann (2010) points out that violent video GAME playing
   may be similar to other public health threats such as exposure to
   cigarette smoke and led based paint .  Despite not being guaranteed,
   the probability of lung cancer from smoking or intelligence deficits
   from lead exposure is increased.  Nevertheless, we have laws
   controlling cigarette sales to minors and the use of lead-based paint
   (and other lead-based products such as gasoline) because it is a risk
   factor for negative health outcomes.  Huesmann argues the same analysis
   could be applied to video GAME exposure.  Although exposure to violent
   video GAME is not the sole factor contributing to aggression and
   violence among children and adolescents, it is a contributing risk
   factor that is modifiable.

Violent behavior is determined by many factors

   Finally, most researchers would agree that violent behavior is
   determined by many factors which may combine in different ways for
   different youth. These factors involve neighborhoods, families, peers,
   and individual traits and behaviors. Researchers, for example, have
   found that living in a violent neighborhood and experiencing violence
   as a victim or witness is associated with an increased risk for violent
   behavior among youth. Yet, this factor alone may not cause one to be
   violent and most people living in such a neighborhood do not become
   violent perpetrators. Similarly, researchers have found consistently
   that exposure to family violence (e.g., spousal and child abuse,
   fighting and conflict) increases the risk for youth violent behavior,
   but does not necessarily result in violent children. Likewise,
   researchers have found that first person killing video GAME playing is
   associated with increased risk for violent behavior, but not all the
   time. Yet, constant exposure to violence from multiple sources,
   including first person violent video GAME, in the absence of positive
   factors that help to buffer these negative exposures is likely to
   increase the probability that youth will engage in violent behavior.

   Despite disagreements on the exact nature of the relationship between
   violent video GAME playing and violent or aggressive behavior,
   significant evidence exists linking video GAME playing with violent
   behavior and its correlates.  Although we are somewhat agnostic about
   the role of social controls like laws banning the sale of violent video
   GAME to minors, an argument against such social controls based on the
   conclusion  that the video GAME have no effect seems to oversimplify
   the issue. A more in-depth and critical analysis of the issue from
   multiple perspectives may both help more completely understand the
   causes and correlates of youth violence, and provide us with some
   direction for creative solutions to this persistent social problem.

   GAME-based Learning / 5 Interactive GAME about Culture

5 Interactive GAME about Culture

   By Med Kharbach, PhD | Last Update: November 2, 2023

   GAME about culture are the topic of our blog post today!

   Google Arts &amp Culture acts as an enlightening window to the cultural
   diversity that our world has to offer. This treasure trove of knowledge
   allows students to step out of the confines of their classrooms and
   immerse themselves in a globally-informed learning journey.
   GAME about Culture GAME about Culture

   In an earlier post here in Educators Technology, I delved into the
   myriad opportunities Google Arts &amp Culture presents to enrich cultural
   literacy among students. I highlighted 10 practical and engaging ways
   in which students can tap into this valuable resource. Today, I am
   eager to zero in on one specific, and arguably highly effective, method
   – the utilization of GAME-based learning.

   One remarkable feature of Google Arts &amp Culture is its dedicated GAME
   section, designed with the aim to make learning about art and culture
   an enjoyable, interactive experience. This section boasts five distinct
   GAME about culture, each serving as an innovative gateway to an
   educational adventure.

   These GAME serve as brilliant tools to pique curiosity, encourage
   exploration, and deepen understanding about various aspects of art and
   culture. Below, you’ll find more details about these cultural GAME.
   But before that, let’s first talk about the importance of introducing
   students to GAME about culture.

Importance of GAME about Culture

   GAME about culture play a critical role in enhancing students
   educational experience in several key ways:
    1. Engagement and Interest: Incorporating GAME into the learning
       process can significantly increase students’ engagement levels. The
       interactive nature of GAME, with their scoring systems, rewards,
       and visual storytelling elements, can make learning about culture a
       fun and exciting experience, thereby stimulating greater interest
       in the subject matter.
    2. Deeper Understanding: GAME often involve problem-solving
       activities that require a deep understanding of the rules, context,
       and the scenario being presented. This immersive learning can
       enable students to comprehend cultural contexts, practices, and
       history in a more nuanced and personal way.
    3. Practical Application: GAME allow students to apply what they’ve
       learned in practical scenarios. For instance, students might use
       their knowledge of a specific culture to interact with its virtual
       representations in a GAME, thereby reinforcing their understanding.
    4. Empathy and Perspective-taking: Cultural GAME can help students
       step into the shoes of people from other cultures, broadening their
       perspectives and enhancing their empathy. This can foster greater
       cultural sensitivity and respect for diversity.
    5. Memory Retention: The active participation required in GAME can
       help improve memory retention. Information learned in the course of
       gameplay is often better remembered than information delivered in
       more traditional, passive forms of learning.
    6. Cross-Cultural Communication Skills: Many cultural GAME encourage
       communication and collaboration among players. This can enhance
       students’ ability to communicate effectively with people from
       diverse cultural backgrounds, a skill that is increasingly
       important in our globally connected world.

   Indeed, GAME about culture provide a valuable tool for students to
   engage with and understand the rich diversity of world cultures. They
   are not just fun to play, but also foster critical skills and values
   such as empathy, critical thinking, communication, and a respect for
   diversity.

Best GAME about culture from Google Arts &amp Culture

   Here is a list of the best GAME about culture from Google Arts &amp
   Culture:

1- What Came First

   What Came First What Came First

   An interactive GAME where students pick which comes first. The faster
   students answer, the more points they get. Students are provided with
   two visual prompts and are asked to click on the one that is
   chronologically older.

   These visual prompts come in different forms including: pictures of
   artists, architectural symbols, museums, inventors, and many more. Once
   students choose an answer they can then scroll down to read more on the
   visual prompts.

2- Cultural Crosswords

Final thoughts

   From “What Came First” to “Art Coloring Book,” each of the featured
   culture GAME has been crafted not just to educate but to captivate,
   turning every click and puzzle piece into a conversation with history
   and culture. Whether through the immediacy of a timed quiz or the
   contemplative pace of a crossword, students are invited to a dance of
   learning that’s both intuitive and insightful.

   As students engage with these GAME, they get to broaden their cultural
   horizons and develop invaluable skills like empathy, critical thinking,
   and cross-cultural communication. Indeed, Google Arts &amp Culture is

How do you play Monopoly? Setup, rules, instructions, gameplay and how to win
     __________________________________________________________________

   Olivia Munson   USA TODAY

   First created in the 1900s, Monopoly was known as The Landlord's GAME
   and reflected “the present system of land-grabbing with all its usual
   outcomes and consequences,” according to the Guardian. Since then,
   Monopoly has become a staple and is recognized as the most popular
   board GAME by Guinness World Records.

   From its famous original to various themed incarnations, such as
   Marvel, Hello Kitty and Animal Crossing, Monopoly has one objective in
   mind: win by becoming the wealthiest player through buying, renting and
   selling property.

   If you're looking to make bank and have your sights on Boardwalk and
   Park Place, here's what you need to know on how to play Monopoly and
   other information about the GAME.

   Just Curious:  We're here to answer your everyday questions.

What comes in a Monopoly GAME?

   Monopoly can be played with just two or up to eight players. A typical
   Monopoly GAME can last anywhere from 20 minutes to 3 hours, depending
   on how many players.

   To get started, you need a Monopoly board and its corresponding pieces.
   According to Hasbro, each Monopoly GAME set includes:
     * A GAME board
     * Eight tokens
     * 28 title deed cards
     * 16 Chance cards
     * 16 Community Chest cards
     * 32 houses
     * 12 hotels
     * Two dice
     * Monopoly money pack
     * Instructions

   First, place the board on a table or flat surface. Then, set the Chance
   and Community Chest cards on their respective spots on the board. From
   there, each player will select their respective token which they will
   use to move around the board.

What are the GAME pieces in Monopoly?

   There are eight tokens, or GAME pieces, used in Monopoly. In the
   standard GAME, the tokens are:
     * Top hat
     * Battle ship
     * Race car
     * Scottie dog
     * Cat (Hazel)
     * Rubber ducky
     * Penguin
     * Thimble

   In 2017, the thimble was replaced by the T-Rex after more than 4.3
   million votes were sent in to replace the GAME piece, as well as to
   change the boot and wheelbarrow to a rubber ducky and penguin,
   according to CNN. However, after the "Throwback Token Vote," the T-Rex
   is now extinct while the thimble is back.  An updated version including
   the new thimble will hit shelves in fall 2022.

   in the US and the history behind them

How much money do you start with in Monopoly?

   At the start of each GAME, players begin with $1,500 in Monopoly
   money, according to the official GAME instructions. The currency is
   broken down into:
     * Two $500s
     * Two $100s
     * Two $50s
     * Six $20s
     * Five $10s
     * Five $5s
     * Five $1s

   The remainder of bills go to the bank with one player acting as the
   banker, who is in charge of divvying up money and collecting fees. The
   banker must keep their personal funds separate from the bank. If there
   are more than five players, the banker may choose to act only as the
   banker and auctioneer, opting to not play.

   Along with money, the bank also holds the Title Deed cards, houses and
   hotels. The banker auctions the properties to other players and gives
   them the corresponding deed cards, as well as sells houses and
   hotels and loans money for required mortgages. The bank also collects
   taxes, fines, loans and interest when players are asked to pay.

   According to the official instructions, the bank never "goes broke,"
   and if it does run out of money, the banker can issue as much as needed
   by making more on regular paper.

How to play Monopoly

   To officially start the GAME, each player will roll the pair of dice,
   starting with the banker. Whoever has the highest total will be the
   first player, and the remaining players will rotate to the left.

   All players must set their token on the corner marked "GO." Then, each
   person takes turns rolling the dice and moving their token in the
   direction of the indicated arrows. The tokens remain on the landed
   spaces until their next turn, proceeding forward once they roll again.
   Two or more tokens can be on the same space at the same time.

   Depending on the space your token lands on, you have the option to buy
   real estate or other properties, as well as pay rent or taxes, draw a
   Chance or Community Chest card and even "Go to Jail." If you throw
   doubles three times in a row, a player must move their token "In
   Jail."

   Keep alternating turns until one player is the wealthiest of the group,
   leaving all other players bankrupt.

Monopoly rules, explained

   Each time a player makes their way around the board and lands on or
   passes GO, the banker pays them $200. The $200 is paid for every
   complete pass of the board, meaning if a player passes GO twice in a
   GAME, they collect $200 twice, $400 in total.

   If a player passes GO and lands on either the Community Chest or Chance
   space in the same turn, drawing the "Advance to GO" card, the player
   collects a total of $400: $200 for passing initially and another $200
   for a second time by the instructions on the card.

   The Community Chest and Chance cards are drawn when a player lands on
   the respective spaces. Once pulled, the player must follow the
   instructions on the card and return it to the bottom of the deck.

   The coveted "Get Out of Jail Free" card is held until used and then
   returned like the other cards. A player can choose to sell the "Get Out
   of Jail Free" card instead of using it.

   When your token lands on free parking, nothing happens. This is just a
   "free" resting place.

Understanding Monopoly jail and how to get out

   You may land in jail for one of three reasons, according to Monopoly
   rules:
     * Your GAME piece lands on the "Go to Jail" space
     * You draw a card marked "Go to Jail"
     * You roll doubles three times in a row

   When you head to jail, you do not collect $200, even if you pass GO to
   get to the space.

   If your piece lands in the actual Jail space during the course of a
   GAME without being sent there, you are "Just Visiting." There is no
   penalty for this and move forward on your next turn.

   A player can get out of jail in multiple ways:
     * Throwing doubles on any of your next three turns. If you do this,
       you move the amount of spaces rolled
     * Using a "Get Out of Jail Free" card
     * Purchasing a "Get Out of Jail Free" card from another player
     * Paying a fine of $50 before you roll on either of your next two
       turns

   If you do not roll doubles by your third turn while in jail, you must
   pay a $50 fine. After, you are officially out of jail and then proceed
   the number of spaces rolled.

   While a player is in jail, you can still buy and sell property, buy and
   sell houses and hotels and collect rents.

   Gotta catch 'em all! Here's how to play the Pokémon trading card GAME.

Buying property, paying rent and more

   When your token lands on an unowned property, you may purchase the
   property for its price. The banker will give you the Title Deed card
   and place the card face up in front of you.

   If you do not want to purchase the property, the banker can choose to
   auction it. Bidding can start at any price and all players, including
   the one who initially declined to buy it, can bid. The highest bidder
   pays the agreed amount and receives the deed card.

   When you land on a property you do not own, you must pay "Rent." The
   rent amount is specified on the Title Deed card and you must pay it
   to the property owner.

   If the property is mortgaged, no rent is collected. A property is
   mortgaged if the Title Deed card is facedown in front of the owner.

   If you own all the Title Deed cards of a color group, the owner can
   charge double the rent for unimproved properties. In a standard U.S.
   Monopoly GAME, the color sets and prices are:
     * Brown: Mediterranean Avenue and Baltic Avenue ($60 each)
     * Light Blue: Oriental Avenue and Vermont Avenue ($100 each),
       Connecticut Avenue ($120)
     * Pink: St. Charles Place and States Avenue ($140 each), Virginia
       Avenue ($160)
     * Orange: St. James Place and Tennessee Avenue Price ($180 each), New
       York Avenue ($200)
     * Red: Kentucky Avenue and Indiana Avenue ($220 each), Illinois
       Avenue ($240)
     * Yellow: Atlantic Avenue and Ventnor Avenue ($260 each), Marvin
       Gardens ($280)
     * Green: Pacific Avenue and North Carolina Avenue ($300
       each), Pennsylvania Avenue ($320)
     * Dark Blue: Park Place ($350) and Boardwalk ($400)

   If the owner of a property forgets to ask for rent before a second
   player rolls the dice, they do not collect payment.

   Unimproved properties, railroads and utilities can be sold from player
   to player for any price. However, no property can be sold if there are
   buildings on it or any spaces of the same color set. If you wish to
   sell an improved property or any property of its same color set, you
   must sell the buildings back to the bank.

How do the houses and hotels work in Monopoly?

   Each Monopoly GAME set comes with 32 houses and 12 hotels which can be
   purchased to place on properties to increase rent.

   Once a player owns all the properties in a color set, they can buy
   houses to place on the board space. After placing a house on a space,
   the next one you purchase must go on a different unimproved property of
   the same color group or any other complete set you own.

   The new rent price will be indicated on the Title Deed card. Even if
   there is not a house on a space, the player who lands on it must still
   pay double rent if another property of the same color set does have a
   house.

   You can buy as many houses as you wish to put on a property so long as
   you follow the aforementioned rules.

   When a player has four houses on each property of a color group, they
   can opt to purchase a hotel and put it on one of the properties. The
   four houses from that space are given back to the bank, and the player
   pays the banker for the hotel as specified by the Title Deed card. Only
   one hotel can be placed on one property at a time.

   If there are no more houses available, players can choose to sell or
   return their houses to the bank. If there are a limited number of
   houses and hotels and two or more players are looking to buy more than
   what is available, the buildings can be sold at auction to the highest
   bidder.

   When sold back to the back, houses and hotels are half the price they
   were initially paid for. Houses must be sold one at a time in the
   reverse order they were purchased. For example, before selling a house
   on Park Place, you must sell your houses on Boardwalk first. All hotels
   on the same color group can be sold at once.

How do you mortgage properties in Monopoly?

   The mortgage value of a property is printed on its Title Deed card. An
   unimproved property can be mortgaged at any time. In order for an
   improved property to be mortgaged, all the buildings of the color set
   must be sold back to the bank.

   If a property is mortgaged, the owner does not collect rent. However,
   rent is paid for unmortgaged properties of the same color group.

   To remove a mortgage, the property owner must pay the specified amount
   and 10% interest to the bank. Once all the properties of a color set
   are no longer mortgaged, the player can begin to buy back the houses
   and hotels at full price.

   A player can sell its mortgaged property to another for any agreed
   price. If you are the new owner, you can remove the mortgage by paying
   it off plus the 10% interest. If the mortgage cannot be paid in full,
   you must pay 10% interest when purchasing the property.

What happens when you run out of money in Monopoly?

   When a player does not have enough money to pay either another player
   or the bank, they are bankrupt.

   If you owe another player, give them all your valued items and remove
   yourself from the GAME. Your houses and hotels are turned over to the
   bank and the value of them (one-half the amount paid) is given to the
   creditor. If you have a mortgaged property, the new owner must pay the
   mortgage plus 10% interest.

   If a player owes money to the bank, you must turn all your assets over
   to the bank. The banker will then auction off all your property, minus
   the buildings, to the highest bidder. The bankrupt player must remove
   themselves from the GAME. The last player left standing is the winner.

Overview
                                     Video GAME have been a popular form
                                     of entertainment and leisure for
                                     decades and are now the largest
                                     grossing entertainment industry in
                                     the world. At the same time, GAME
                                     are thought to impact a broad range
                                     of human functioning, from subjective
                                     well-being to cognition.
                                     Specifically, some studies have
                                     associated video GAME play with
                                     increased performance in attention
                                     control, working memory, executive
                                     functioning, and other cognitive
                                     abilities.
                                     Because these cognitive abilities
                                     that GAME purportedly affect may
                                     contribute to human functioning more
                                     broadly, such as educational and
                                     career achievement, it is important
                                     that studies are conducted using the
                                     most rigorous and valid methods
                                     available, and that multiple
                                     approaches to the question are
                                     employed. However, the research
                                     record on this topic thus far has had
                                     a blind spot on large,
                                     representative, and ecologically
                                     valid studies.
                                     This project aims to study the
                                     association between video GAME play
                                     and cognition using novel
                                     ecologically valid methods that
                                     improve upon the existing literature
                                     by studying gaming in its natural
                                     context, using actual GAME play data.
                                     We intend to recruit a large
                                     representative sample of gamers from
                                     industry partners’ online platforms,
                                     who would contribute their actual
                                     gameplay data—when, how and what they
                                     play. Volunteers would then complete
                                     online cognitive tasks that measure
                                     their attention control, working
                                     memory, and executive functioning, as
                                     well provide their motivations for
                                     playing. We will then be in a unique
                                     position to examine the naturally
                                     occurring associations between gaming
                                     behaviours and performance on those
                                     cognitive domains.
                                     The main proposed scientific merit of
                                     this study is a robust and
                                     transparent investigation, and a
                                     subsequent open-access publication
                                     and openly available dataset, on the
                                     real-world association between video
                                     GAME play and cognitive performance.

Active GAME

   child obstacle course

1. Obstacle Course

   Everyone loves a good obstacle course. You can create one in your own
   backyard using objects like a play tunnel, a balance beam, hula hoops,
   string, pool noodles, and more. Set up a simple course for little ones
   and model how to complete it before letting them go through. Get your
   older kids involved by having each person be responsible for creating
   one obstacle for the course. You can time them as they go and have them
   try to beat their previous time. Or set up two courses side by side and
   race!

2. Scooter Races

   All you need for this GAME are some scooter boards and a driveway or
   sidewalk. Let your children race each other while sitting on the
   scooter boards.

   Mix it up by playing ‘red light, green light’. Have one person stand at
   the finish line and say “green light” letting the others move forward
   on their scooters. When the person says “red light” everyone must stop.
   If someone keeps scootering forward, they are either out or must start
   back at the beginning (depending on which rules you want to follow).
   The first person on a scooter who reaches the end (you can draw a line
   with chalk) wins. Then that person can be in charge of yelling “red
   light, green light”.

3. Animal Tag

   Spice up a regular GAME of tag with Animal Tag. Designate one area to
   be the “cage” where players will be sent if they are tagged. Choose one
   child to be “it”; They will be the zookeeper responsible for tagging
   all of the animals and sending them back to their “cage”. Choose
   another child to be the mischievous “monkey”; They can tag players to
   let them out of the cage.

   Divide the rest of the children into groups. How many groups depends on
   the number of players, but overall you can have one group hop like
   rabbits, frogs, or kangaroos, another gallop like horses, zebras, or
   antelope, another group run like cheetahs or lions, another can crawl
   like dogs, pigs, or bears or even skip. Choose animals based on your
   theme whether it's the zoo and a cage or a barnyard and a barn.

   For more of a challenge, create different cage areas for each group. Or
   turn it into a GAME of freeze tag and let the monkey unfreeze the other
   players by tagging them.

4. Four Square

   Four Square requires a large flat area, a piece of chalk, a kickball,
   and at least four players. Start by drawing a large square divided into
   four using the piece of chalk. Starting in the top left square, label
   them King, Queen, Jack, and Baby (you could also just label them 1-4).

   Randomly assign children the squares to start. As the GAME progresses,
   they’ll attempt to move into the higher squares. If the “King” is out,
   they either start over at “Baby” or must get in line to wait to get
   back in, depending on the number of players.

   The “Baby” starts with the ball and serves it into another square. The
   next player must hit it into the next square after one bounce. Players
   must continue to bounce the ball from one square to the next. If a
   player hits it out of bounds or can’t pass it before it bounces once,
   they’re out.

   Variations
     * Around the World: Players must pass the ball clockwise. The hitter
       can call out reverse to switch the order before hitting it to now
       pass from counterclockwise.
     * Around the World No Reverse: Same as above, but you can’t reverse
       it.
     * Categories: Let the King choose a category, like food (state, movie
       star, colors, etc.). Each player must name an item in the category
       when they hit it, without repeating something that was previously
       said. If they repeat something, they’re out.
     * Extra Rules
          + Bus Stop: If the King calls “bus stop”, everyone must ignore
            the ball and run to touch the center where all four squares
            meet with their foot, the last one to do so is out.
          + Ballerina Feet: If the King calls “ballerina feet”, the
            players must all rush to their corner and get into first
            position in ballet (heels together, toes out following the
            corner’s lines), the last one to do so is out.
          + Train: If the King calls “train” everyone must quickly get
            onto a line. The other players can shuffle along the lines
            while the King shuffles and tries to tag someone, the person
            tagged is out.
          + Tea Party: If the King calls “tea party with XYZ” those two
            players must bounce the ball back and forth until someone is
            out.

5. Bicycle Fun

   Bikes are another fun outdoor activity. With trikes, bicycles, and
   adaptive tricycles, most children will have fun riding their bikes
   around the neighborhood. You can add GAME too. Play “How Slow Can You
   Go” with a piece of chalk. Draw out a straight or wavy line and time
   your kids to see who can go the slowest without stopping or needing to
   put their foot down. Or create obstacles using cones or cans and have
   your children maneuver around them.

   agility cones
   Buy on Amazon!

6. Sharks and Minnows

   If you’ve got a group of kids, this GAME is a perfect alternative when
   tag starts to get a bit boring. Designate one or more players to be the
   “shark” they will try to tag the minnows. The rest of the players are
   “minnows” and should stand together in a straight line at one end of
   the playing field, all facing the shark in the middle of the field.
   When the shark yells “Swim!” all of the minnows should try to run to
   the other side of the field without being tagged.

   If a minnow is tagged, there are two possible options: You can have
   them become “seaweed” having them sit down and try to reach out for
   other minnows to turn them into seaweed too. Or you can have them
   become additional sharks for the next round.

   Play continues until only one minnow remains untagged, they become the
   new lead shark. This GAME can also be played in a gym class or in the
   pool.

7. Kick the Can

   All you need for this GAME is an empty can and a group of participants.
   Place the can in a large open area. Choose one player to be “It” who
   should then count to 50 while the other players hide. Then It tries to
   find and tag all of the other players. If another player is tagged,
   they must go to the designated “jail” area near the can. Any player who
   hasn’t been tagged can try to “kick the can” to set all of the players
   in jail free. When It has all of the players in jail, they win. Whoever
   was in jail the longest becomes the new It and a new GAME starts.

8. Opinion Tag

   Decide on four spots to be bases. Label them “Love it” “Okay” “Don’t
   like it” “Never tried it”. Choose one person to be “It”. It chooses a
   food, sport, activity, etc. and yells it out loud. For example
   “baseball” or “carrots” or “Spanish class”. All of the other players
   must run to the base that describes how they feel about the chosen
   subject. It tries to tag one of the players as they run. If a player is
   tagged, they become the new It for the next round.

Water GAME

   kid in sprinkler

9. Sponge Tennis

   For this GAME, you’ll need a balloon and a sponge on a stick. You can
   make your own by using a large sponge, a painter’s stick or ruler, and
   tape to wrap around the handle and prevent splinters. Or purchase a
   sponge on a stick for a quicker solution. Children can then bat the
   ball back and forth to play “tennis”, add a net to enhance the GAME. Or
   simply attempt to keep the balloon in the air by working together.

   For extra fun, head outside. Fill a bucket with water and dip the
   sponges into it, then play this GAME with wet sponges! A scrub brush
   sponge stick is designed to get wet!

10. Water Cup Races

   Get two plastic cups and poke a hole in the bottom center of each. Tie
   a string to a secure anchor point, thread a string through the cup and
   tie the other end to another secure point (like a tree branch or
   chair). Bring both cups to the end of their respective strings and hand
   each child a filled water gun. Have the children shoot the water into
   the cups to push the cups along the string. Race to see who can get
   their cup to the end of the string first!

11. Sponge Tag

   Easy to set up and tons of fun, all you need for this GAME is a bucket
   of water and a large car wash sponge. Choose one child to be “It”. It
   should take the sponge and dunk it in the bucket. Then It chases the
   other players trying to tag them with the wet sponge. The first person
   tagged becomes It and refills the sponge.

12. Frozen Feet

   Perfect for cooling down on a hot day, you’ll need ice cubes to play
   this GAME. There are two versions of this GAME.

   Version 1: Fill a tub with ice cubes and place an empty tub beside it.
   Set a time limit (1-2 minutes). See how many ice cubes one child can
   move from the filled bucket to the empty bucket using only their feet.
   Then empty the second bin and let another child try. Whoever can move
   the most cubes within the set amount of time wins!

   Version two: Fill one tub with ice cubes, water, and marbles. See how
   many marbles one child can pick up from within the tub using only their
   feet in a given time limit. Put the marbles back in the tub and let
   another child try. Whoever gets the most marbles wins!

13. Over Under Sponge Relay

   For this GAME you’ll need two large sponges and two buckets that are
   the same size and two large tubs filled with water. Divide the children
   into two groups and have each group stand in a line. Place the full
   tubs in front of the lines and the empty buckets at the end of the
   lines.

   Hand the large sponge to the first person in line. They must dunk the
   sponge and pass it over their head to the next person in line. That
   person must pass it under their legs to the next person who then passes
   it over their head... and so on. The last child in line squeezes the
   sponge out into the bucket then runs to the front of the line and the
   relay continues. The first team to fill their bucket wins.

   If you think this will take too much time, use a small bucket or
   sharpie a fill-to line on the inside of the bucket.

14. Melt the Ice

   This GAME requires a bit of prep work. But it can be used with a
   variety of ages and played individually or in a group.

   Play individually or cooperatively: Get a large container and fill with
   one inch of water, then play a few small toys and freeze. Add more
   water and toys and freeze again. Repeat the process for each layer
   until the container is full. Remove the block of ice and give your
   child tools to melt it. (spoons, salt, paintbrushes, spray bottles,
   etc.) to try and melt the ice and retrieve their treasures.

   Play in a group: This version is a bit easier to prepare. Just fill an
   ice cube tray with one penny and water. Then freeze. Give each child
   one ice cube and see who can melt it (not break it) in their hands
   first and get to the penny. That child is the winner and everyone gets
   to keep a penny!

15. DIY Sprinkler

   Sometimes unstructured play is best. Have your child help you create
   this sprinkler. You’ll need a sturdy plastic bottle, a drill, tape, and
   a garden hose. Use the drill to make holes in the bottle, if you have
   older children you can supervise as they do this step. Then securely
   tape the container to the end of the garden hose. Turn on the water for
   an instant sprinkler! Your children can run through it, jump over it,
   and have plenty of fun

   Looking for fun sprinkler GAME? Your children can play ring-around-the
   rosy, hokey pokey freeze dance, and more around the sprinkler.

16. Water Balloon Toss

   This GAME is a lot like an egg toss but the water balloons instead.
   Start by filling several water balloons. Have the children divide into
   pairs and give each pair one water balloon. Have the children start
   close together and throw the water balloon back and forth. On each
   successful throw, have both children take another step back. If the
   water balloon breaks or the pair fails to make a catch, they’re out.
   The team that ends up the furthest apart wins!

17. Water Limbo

   All you need for this water GAME is a hose. Have an adult hold the hose
   up high with water streaming out of it. Children can take turns
   limboing under the stream. After each round, the adult should lower the
   hose. If the child can’t make it under the steam, they’ll get soaked
   and be out! Last one limboing wins!

18. Drip, Drip Drench!

   This twist on ‘duck, duck, goose’ includes fun water play. Have all of
   the children sit in a circle, except the child who is “It”. The person
   who is “It” should walk around the circle holding a sopping wet sponge
   over each child’s head. As they pass they should say “Drip, drip, drip”
   until they get to a chosen player and say “Drench” squeezing the sponge
   over the person’s head. The chosen player gets up and chases it around
   the circle trying to tag them. It tries to make it around the circle
   once and to sit in the chosen player’s spot. If It is tagged, they must
   sit in the center of the circle until someone else is tagged. The
   chosen player becomes the next It. Resoak the sponge and start again!

19. Ping Pong Toss

   Grab a ping pong ball, a sharpie, and several plastic cups. Label the
   cups numbers 1-5. Fill the cups halfway with water and set the cups up
   so the ones labelled 1 are closer and the ones labelled higher numbers
   are further away. Give a child five ping pong balls and let them throw
   them into the cups for points. You could also let the children throw as
   many ping pong balls as they can in thirty seconds. Then let the next
   child take a turn. The child with the most points wins.

Messy GAME

20. Egg Roulette and Other Egg GAME

   You may want to put down a cheap plastic throw away tarp for these
   GAME.

   hidden in the mix. One at a time the child should crack an egg on their
   head until one breaks.

   Egg Toss: Divide the children into pairs and give each pair one raw
   egg. They must toss the egg back and forth, taking a step back after

   first child to get to the finish line and back without dropping their
   egg wins. If the egg drops, the child must start over from the start
   line. If the egg breaks, they’re out.

   need five tongue depressors, each marked with a color of the rainbow.
   You will also need matching face paint colors. Hide the tongue
   depressor and matching face paint in a variety of places around the
   yard.

   Choose someone to be “It”. All of the other players run off in search
   of the sticks. When they find a stick, they should put a stripe of the
   matching face paint on their cheek and then continue searching without
   letting anyone else know where the stick is.

   In the meantime, the It tries to tag the other players. If It tags a
   player, It can wipe off one stripe of color from their face.

   The first player to get stripes of each color on their face wins!

22. Squirt Gun Painting/Tag

   For these GAME you’ll need squirt guns filled with liquid watercolors.

   Squirt Gun Painting: Set up easels with paper or tack paper to a tree.
   Fill each squirt gun with a different color. Then give each child a
   squirt gun and let them spray the paper to paint it. Your children can
   switch guns to mix different colors.

   Squirt Gun Tag: Make sure everyone is wearing a white shirt that can
   get dirty. Fill the squirt guns with two different liquid watercolors
   and divide everyone into teams. If you get squirted by the other team’s
   gun, you’ve been “hit” and you’re out. Continue until only one player
   remains standing that team wins!

   To extend the GAME, play the color wars version. Individually or in
   teams, each child tries to get the others to be as colorful as possible
   (if a child is “hit” they aren’t out). The child with the most white
   remaining on their shirt at the end of a designated time wins!

   hoop. For an added challenge, play with more than 2 kids.

   small toys or stuffed animals to hide in the balls. Then let your child

   competition by seeing who can find the most toys the fastest. Hide the
   toys again and replay.

26. Giant GAME

   Twister: Play a giant GAME of twister on the yard. You’ll need a
   spinner from a regular GAME of Twister or by creating it yourself. Then
   use four spray paint cans to create a board on the grass and play
   regular Twister. You’ll have a fun GAME to play until the grass is
   mowed.

   tic-tac-toe board. Choose items like hula hoops or other items to play

   physical with this sidewalk chalk GAME. Create a Simon GAME board out
   of chalk. Form a circle with sections of color.

   the center again. Next, say the first color and a new color and have
   your child repeat the jumping sequence. Continue adding colors until
   your child can no longer remember the sequence.

   Switch it up by using numbers, letters, or other pictures in the
   sections instead.

28. Snakes and Worms

   Get green and brown strings and cut them into several pieces. Hide the
   pieces of yarn around the yard. Divide the children into two groups and
   choose one captain. The children will run around the yard looking for
   yarn. And the captain’s will stand in the center of the yard and tie
   the yarn onto together to create a long worm/snake. The team with the
   longest piece of string wins.

29. Quarter Bounce

   All you need for this simple GAME is a quarter and a bouncy ball. Place
   the quarter in the sidewalk crack. Have one child stand on each square
   and bounce the ball attempting to knock the quarter out. The first
   child to knock the quarter out of the sidewalk crack wins.

30. Marbles

   This classic GAME requires sidewalk chalk, small marbles, and large
   marbles. Use the chalk to draw a three foot diameter circle with a line
   through the center. Each player needs a large marble to use as a
   “shooter”. Place 10-15 marbles in the center of the circle. Shoot your
   marble by flicking it from the ground. Grab whatever marbles you manage
   to knock out of the circle. Continue knocking marbles out until none
   remain. Whoever has the most marbles at the end wins.

   If you don’t knock a marble out of the circle, you must leave your
   “shooter” in play. If the other player knocks it out on their turn,
   they win and the GAME ends. Otherwise you may pick it up again on your
   next turn.

31. Simon Says

   Choose one player to be “Simon”. Simon will give commands to the other
   players. If Simon begins the command by saying “Simon Says” everyone
   must follow the command. If Simon begins the command without saying
   “Simon Says” players aren’t allowed to do the action.

   For example, if Simon says, “Simon Says touch your toes!” you must
   touch your toes, if you don’t, you’re out. If Simon says, “Touch your
   toes!” you shouldn’t touch your toes. If you do, you’re out.

   The last player standing wins and gets to be Simon for the next round.

32. Scavenger Hunt

   Create a scavenger hunt for your children to do out in the backyard.
   You can hide written clues for them to find and follow to a treasure.
   For example, a clue like “Climb up and then down, down you go. Look for
   me on the ground below” could lead your child to the area under the
   slide to find the next clue.

   Or create a list of objects (a stick, a leaf, a round stone, etc.) that
   they need to find. The first one to find all of the objects on the list
   wins and gets a prize.

Beyond Wordle: the best word GAME to try next

   Whether you are frustrated by the smash hit puzzle, or hungry for more,
   there are endless alternatives out there - but which are the best?

   The debate continues to rage among Wordle players: has the New York
   Times ruined it? Why are there suddenly so many double-letter days
   (SWILL, seriously?); so many frustrating solutions that hinge on a
   single, ambiguous letter? And what about “caulk”? Has something
   changed? Or are people just losing interest? Since Wordle caught the
   world’s attention, there has been a fast-flowing stream of copycats and
   humorous takes on the word-guessing GAME, based on everything from
   swearing (Sweardle) to choral music (Byrdle) to geography (Worldle). If
   you’re looking for something different, though, rather than just an
   inventive twist on the same theme, the Android and Apple app stores
   have many other word GAME you can play on your phone. Fans have been
   quietly enjoying some of these for years – some offer a daily five or
   10 minutes of puzzle fun, while others let you sink as much time into
   them as you want.
   SpellTower
   SpellTower

SpellTower

   SpellTower is an inspired combination of Boggle and Tetris, in which
   players make words out of adjacent letter tiles in order to clear the
   play space. In the puzzle mode, subsequent layers of letters are
   continually added until the pile reaches the top of the screen and the
   GAME ends. It’s a unique and compelling test of both your vocabulary
   and your spatial planning skills, and like Wordle it gets you to see
   words as tactical objects as well as units of language.
   Wurdweb
   Wurdweb

Wurdweb

   This is a really fascinating take on Scrabble, which gives you a
   selection of words and then challenges you to place them on the board
   without running out of playable spaces. It sounds easy, but if you add
   too many words in one corner you can soon come adrift, and you have to
   make careful use of the premium squares. Scrabble fans will enjoy the
   way the GAME explores word placement strategies, and success unlocks
   the more demanding “precise mode”, which requires players to finish on
   a specific square. Not for the faint-hearted.
   Baba Is You
   Baba Is You

Baba Is You

   As much a logic GAME as a word GAME, this endearingly lo-fi puzzler has
   you shifting words around to change the rules. Unshiftable boulders can
   be pushed aside if you create the sentence ROCK IS MOVE; if there’s a
   key hidden down a maze, try KEY IS YOU and you can possess it and move
   it somewhere more accessible. It will outsmart you, but it will also
   make you feel like a genius when you crack it.
   Letter Quest: Grimm’s Journey
   Letter Quest: Grimm’s Journey

Letter Quest: Grimm’s Journey

   A kind of slightly violent Scrabble, in Letter Quest, you guide a cute
   little grim reaper through dungeons full of monsters, defeating them by
   conjuring impressive words from a panel of letter tiles. Any word will
   do damage, but the fun comes from figuring out particularly appropriate
   or long ones; there’s nothing quite as satisfying as defeating a
   werewolf with “silver”. It’s a lovely combination of word puzzles and
   old-school dungeon-delving adventure. Anyone who played the fondly
   remembered Bookworm Adventures, sadly now scrubbed from existence, will
   especially enjoy this.
   Love Wordle? Here are three reasons why you’ll love cryptic crosswords
   Read more

Kitty Letter

   In this gently bizarre, free GAME, you unscramble words from a
   hexagonal grid of letters to send little armies of exploding cats
   towards your opponent’s house. It’s quite frantic, rather than
   contemplative, and more fun against a friend (or a stranger) online,
   but there’s a single-player mode too, featuring surreal interactive
   comics.
   Typeshift
   Typeshift

Typeshift

   This is not unlike Wordle – there’s a word that the GAME wants you to
   guess, and you have to puzzle it out – but this gives you a slot
   machine wheel of different letters, and you spin each column around
   with your finger until something makes sense. It also has a mode where
   you have to figure out several words from crossword-style clues,
   working with what you’re given. There’s something very satisfying about
   the tactile nature of Typeshift, like playing with a padlock
   combination made of letters.
   Alphabear: Words Across Time
   Alphabear: Words Across Time

Alphabear: Words Across Time

   This is much cuter and weirder than anything you’ll find in a newspaper
   puzzle app – it features little collectible square-headed bears, and
   making longer, better words out of the letter grid in front of you
   creates more, bigger bears. It pairs word-building with the human
   appetite for collecting things. The words you’ve spelled then get made
   into absurd cartoons after every round. It’s very funny and adorable,
   and appealing enough to draw kids into some spelling-related fun.

Board GAME types explained: a beginner's guide to tabletop gaming terms

   How to tell your roll-and-writes from your roll-and-moves.

   Getting into tabletop gaming as a beginner can be a challenge. From
   knowing the best board GAME, working out what to buy first and finding
   others interested in playing them with you, through to understanding
   the conversation when you meet these peers, there are all sorts of
   potential barriers to even the friendliest of pastimes.

   Board gaming, as one of humanity’s oldest hobbies, can be one of the
   most welcoming activities around. You can start anywhere and with
   anyone - you can learn how to play D&ampD in a board GAME shop or café,
   crack out a party board GAME down the pub, learn how to play Magic: The
   Gathering with an established club, or simply enjoy playing around the
   kitchen table with your friends or even all by yourself thanks to the
   growing number of solo GAME.

   But like everything that a lot of people spend a lot of time on, a
   whole specialist language has built up around board GAME, not least of
   which is the various genres that tabletop GAME get grouped into.
   What’s a deckbuilder compared to a deck construction GAME? What makes a
   living card GAME different to a trading card GAME, and is that the same
   as an expandable deck GAME? What do you actually do in a
   worker-placement board GAME?

   Fear not; to help those of you who haven’t yet had a proper chance to
   learn your roll-and-writes from your roll-and-moves, Dicebreaker has
   put together the following beginner’s guide to the different types of
   board GAME types and what they mean.

   Bear in mind that many of these board GAME types aren’t exhaustive or
   exclusive, and many board GAME will fall into more than one of these
   categories - or might be something else entirely. However, the
   following board GAME terms represent the most common types of GAME on
   the tabletop, so they’re a good place to start next time you’re
   wondering if something really is a EuroGAME, or just happens to have a
   farmer on the cover.

Board GAME types

Abstract

   Board GAME with no theme at all, or what theme is offered is so
   disconnected from the actual experience of playing that it might as
   well not be there. Draughts and Go are the purest examples of
   abstracts, while chess - with its set of named pieces and suggestion of
   historical warfare - is relatively thematic by the standards of the
   category.

   Examples: Draughts, chess, Go, Tak, Shobu, Hive, Santorini, Azul and
   its sequels.

Area control

   Board GAME with some form of map or board defining a space that
   players compete to dominate, usually through adding their own pieces to
   regions or areas or removing opponents’ pieces. Sometimes the control
   can come through denying access to areas rather than taking them
   yourself - it could be argued that Scrabble is an example of the genre!

   Examples: Small World, Risk, Nanty Narking, Blood Rage.

Campaign/legacy

   Campaign board GAME are defined by individual plays following a series
   of connected scenarios, where the actions and outcome of one scenario
   will usually affect the next. Legacy board GAME are a specific type of
   campaign GAME where your choices and actions cause you to make
   permanent (often physical) changes to the GAME and its components, such
   as applying stickers to the board or tearing up cards, often providing
   a one-time experience.

   Examples: Gloomhaven, Pandemic Legacy, Charterstone, Betrayal Legacy.

Deckbuilder

   Each player starts with their own identical deck of cards, but alters
   it during play, with more powerful cards being added to the deck and
   less powerful ones removed. Deckbuilders are sometimes conflated with
   deck construction GAME such as trading card GAME, with the difference
   being that in deckbuilders the act of creating and customising your
   deck is part of the core gameplay experience, instead of something that
   usually happens away from the table between plays.

   Examples: Dominion, Star Realms, Undaunted: Normandy, Harry Potter:
   Hogwarts Battle.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3Z5UxN-pQkU?autoplay=0

Deck construction

   A type of board GAME where the players use different decks of cards to
   play, constructed prior to the GAME from a large pool of options,
   according to specific rules. There are two main distribution models:
   trading or collectible card GAME sell booster pack products with a
   randomised set of cards in each, while living card GAME and expandable
   deck GAME provide a fixed set of cards in each expansion. (Living card
   GAME applies specifically to such GAME produced by Fantasy Flight
   GAME, which has trademarked the term.)

   Examples: Magic: The Gathering, Android: Netrunner, Marvel Champions,
   Arkham Horror: The Card GAME.

Dexterity

   Board GAME involving physical skill, whether using the whole body as
   in Twister or just the fingers for moving things about, as with
   removing blocks in Jenga. This can include flicking discs or other
   objects with your fingers like Flick ‘em Up, balancing things in GAME
   such as Beasts of Balance or even throwing objects around, like Dungeon
   Fighter.

   Examples: Cube Quest, Catacombs, Flip Ships, Flick ‘em Up, crokinole,
   Beasts of Balance.

Drafting

   Drafting is a mechanic where players are presented with a set of
   options (usually cards, though sometimes dice) from which they must
   pick one, leaving the remainder for the next player to choose from. The
   selection may be made from a shared central pool of choices, or from a
   hand of cards passed between players. This can be a small part of a
   GAME, such as selecting an ability for use during a round, or the
   entire decision space for a GAME.

   Examples: 7 Wonders, Sushi Go!, Villagers.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-_jeoWEyBEI?autoplay=0

Dungeon-crawler

   Players take the roles of characters making their way through a
   location, often depicted by a map with a square grid or a page in a
   book, defeating enemies controlled by another player, a companion app
   or the GAME system itself.

   Examples: Gloomhaven, Mansions of Madness, Star Wars: Imperial Assault,
   Mice and Mystics.

Engine-builder

   Over the course of an engine-building board GAME, you’ll build an
   “engine”: something that takes your starting resources and/or actions
   and turns them into more resources, which turn into even more
   resources, which - somewhere along the line - will usually turn into a
   form of victory points.

   Examples: Res Arcana, Century: Spice Road, Race for the Galaxy.

EuroGAME

   Often shortened to just ‘Euro’, these are strategy-focused board GAME
   that prioritise limited-randomness over theme. Usually competitive with
   interaction between players through passive competition rather than
   aggressive conflict. Named for the fact many of the early GAME of this
   style were developed in Europe - particularly Germany - in contrast to
   the more thematic but chance-driven “American-style” GAME of the time.
   (Sometimes referred to as 'Ameritrash' by those who dislike the high
   luck element.)

   Examples: Agricola, Paladins of the West Kingdom.
   The Quacks of Quedlinburg board GAME box and components The Quacks of
   Quedlinburg - a GAME in which pushing your luck leads to victory (or
   everything blowing up in your face).

Push-your-luck

   Board GAME that invite you to take ever bigger risks to achieve
   increasingly valuable rewards - or to decide to keep what you’ve got
   before you lose everything. Think the card GAME blackjack or deciding
   whether to give an uncertain answer on Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
   Sometimes also called press-your-luck.

   Examples: The Quacks of Quedlinburg, Port Royal, Deep Sea Adventure.

Roll-and-move

   Board GAME where you roll one or more dice and move that many spaces -
   commonly on a looping track of spaces, or a path with a start and
   finish. Often landing on certain spaces will trigger specific actions
   or offer the player certain gameplay options. Simple as that.

   Examples: Monopoly, The GAME of Life, Snakes and Ladders, Formula D.

Roll-and-write

   Roll some dice and decide how to use the outcome, writing it into a
   personal scoring sheet. Each decision impacts your options for the rest
   of the GAME, so even in GAME where everyone uses the same dice,
   slightly different choices at the start can lead to very different end
   results. Some GAME twist the name by replacing the dice with something
   like cards for a ‘flip-and-write’ (Welcome To…) or the writing with
   something like placing miniatures for a ‘roll-and-build’ (Era: Medieval
   Age).

   Examples: Yahtzee, Railroad Ink, Ganz Schon Clever, Corinth.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DE_kg4ZB0pk?autoplay=0

Social deduction

   One or more players around the table have a secret, and the rest of you
   need to figure out who! Expect lying, bluffing and wild accusations all
   round. Players are often secretly assigned hidden roles that only they
   know, and must achieve their own objectives - commonly either finding
   the odd one out, or hiding the fact that you are the odd one out
   yourself.

   Examples: Blood on the Clocktower, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, The
   Resistance.

Storytelling

   Board GAME with a focus on narrative and description that is directed
   or fully created by the players. This could be an overarching story
   lasting the whole GAME - or across a campaign of multiple sessions -
   read from pre-written passages, or a sequence of vignettes as players
   are tasked with inventing and describing something prompted by a single
   card.

   Examples: The King’s Dilemma, Tales of the Arabian Nights.

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x3UqyzjFmqg?autoplay=0

Worker-placement

   Board GAME where you choose actions from spaces on the board by
   assigning your pool of “workers” - often thematically actual workers in
   your employ - to them. Usually EuroGAME, with player interaction
   created because actions one player has taken often can’t be taken by or
   come with a cost for anyone else.

   Examples: Charterstone, Agricola, Caverna, Lords of Waterdeep.

WarGAME

   Players pit armies against each other, represented by collections of
   miniatures or tokens on a map, with a grid or actual measured distances
   for movement. Eliminate the opponent’s figures or achieve objectives to
   win, with combat usually dictated by dice rolls or card play.

   Examples: Warhammer 40,000, Memoir ‘44, Risk, Axis &amp Allies.

The Best Adult Board GAME, According to Cool People

   Portrait of Dominique Pariso
   By Dominique Pariso, a writer at the Strategist since 2018.   (BUTTON)
   She covers office goods, sex toys, and home-bar essentials and is also
   a writer for “The Approval Matrix.”

   Board GAME are a great way to break the ice, whether you’re at a party
   or hosting a get-together with folks you haven’t seen in a while. But
   with so many options available — from strategy board GAME to social
   ones that require singing or drawing — it can be hard to find the right
   one for you and your friends. So while we’ve written about board GAME
   before — including the best two-player board GAME, best family board
   GAME, and best board GAME for kids — here, I’ve rounded up the 24
   best board GAME for adults, according to fellow Strategist staffers,
   contributors, and a variety of people who play them all the time.

Best overall party board GAME for adults

   Just One
   Just One
   From $57

   “Hands down, Just One is our favorite new party GAME,” says Kelsey
   Demers, who runs the board-GAME blog the Tabletop Family. “It’s simple
   to play, a breeze to teach, and utterly addictive.” Word-association
   GAME are a great choice to play with friends in larger groups because
   they are “full of inside-joke possibilities and they let you make new
   memories by reliving old ones,” explains Meeple Mountain founder Andy
   Matthews. The main objective, as the title suggests, is for players to
   help their teammates guess a word by suggesting “just one” word as a
   hint. Which sounds easy enough, but, as Matthews warns: “Watch out,
   duplicate words cancel each other out.” A right answer scores your team
   one point, while a wrong answer docks two points, with the ultimate
   goal being to get as many points out of 13 as possible.

Best strategy GAME for adults

   Amigo 'Saboteur' Strategy Card GAME
   Amigo ‘Saboteur’ Strategy Card GAME
   $11
   [DEL: $13 :DEL] now 15% off
   $11

   “The premise of Saboteur, an inexpensive, whimsically mining-themed
   GAME designed by Frederic Moyersoen and produced by German GAME
   company Amigo, is relatively simple: Players work toward a shared goal,
   but some of their number — the saboteurs — are secretly working against
   the majority, the miners,” explains Strategist writer Erin Schwartz,
   who compares it to similar GAME like Mafia and Among Us. “Although
   Saboteur is a tabletop GAME, the basic unit of play is the same, which
   is talking to your friends to figure out who’s working against the
   group.” While the GAME can be played with as few as three, Schwartz
   finds its best for larger groups of five or more players, to keep
   things interesting. The GAME scales well to groups of different skill
   level and competitiveness, they add. “But with a group of seasoned
   liars and scammers, it can get downright Machiavellian with
   increasingly baroque tests of fidelity, side deals, and emotional
   appeals to the friends you intend to betray.”

   If you’re looking for a more entry-level strategy GAME, Ticket to Ride
   is an adventure-style GAME in which players attempt to cross the
   country and connect cities by building train routes. It is easy to pick
   up “but also offers a level of strategy and tactics just deep enough
   for competitive gamers to return to time and again,” says Ian Ross, who
   runs the popular Instagram page Board GAME As Art.

Best fast-paced strategy board GAME for adults

   Raccoon Tycoon
   ‘Raccoon Tycoon’
   $23
   $23

   Strategist senior writer Liza Corsillo discovered this GAME by way of
   her “strategy-GAME connoisseur” brother and it quickly became a family
   GAME-night staple. According to Corsillo, Raccoon Tycoon combines the
   fast play of Ticket to Ride with the social interaction of Settlers of
   Catan, “but is more engaging and fun to look at.” Like Ticket to Ride,
   a player will win the GAME by collecting the most points, “but there
   are multiple ways to earn them — amassing wealth and owning railroads,
   towns, or buildings — so it’s harder to get bored.” Corsillo also notes
   that part of what sets Raccoon Tycoon apart is “the intricate, uncanny
   illustrations,” designed by painter Annie Stegg. “Every time I play, I
   discover some clever detail that makes me laugh,” she adds. “Another
   perk is that you can play with as few as two people or as many as five,
   and though you have to pay attention to multiple things at once, it’s
   not so complicated that a beginner or child couldn’t win on their first
   time playing.”

Best adult board GAME for pop-culture fans

   Monikers
   ‘Monikers’
   [DEL: $30 :DEL] now 17% off
   $25

   “Based on the classic parlor GAME Celebrity, Monikers is a silly social
   affair for four to 20 friends,” says Dylan Speed of Meeple Mountain.
   Players give clues to teammates, hoping they’ll guess what’s on the
   card which could be anything from a world-famous pop star to a brief
   viral sensation, or even an obscure concept like sausage fingers, he
   explains — which makes it an excellent pick for pop-culture fans. “Over
   three rounds that allow progressively fewer words — from unlimited, to
   one, to none (charades) — everyone will shout and laugh their way
   through an evening of making nonsense and new inside jokes,” promises
   Speed.

   “Using only a couple words as clues, can you get your team to correctly
   guess your words?” Dr. Joey J. Lee, director of the GAME Research Lab
   and coordinator of the M.A. Program in Design and Development of
   Digital GAME at Teachers College, Columbia University, asks about the
   basic premise of this spy-themed Czech favorite. Similar to the basic
   elements of charades, players divide into two teams with one designated
   spymaster providing clues. By guessing the words correctly, players
   unveil the other teams’ agents. The first to unmask all of its
   opponents’ spies wins.

Best drawing-focused board GAME for adults

   Telestrations
   ‘Telestrations’
   $32

   “This is my favorite party GAME when mixing kids and adults,” says
   Scott Cooper, owner of Seattle-based Blue Highway GAME. A cross
   between Pictionary and telephone, each player attempts to draw the
   Telestration word they have been given. When the time is up, all
   players pass their sketch to the person next to them, who attempts to
   guess what has been drawn on the dry-erase board. Everyone then passes
   their guess — which ideally matches the previous player’s word — to the
   next player, who is then tasked with drawing it. The GAME is finished
   once all of the boards have been returned to their original player.
   According to Dr. Michael James Heron of Meeple Like Us, a
   board-GAME-review site with a focus on accessibility, “It plays really
   quickly, has everyone laughing all of the time, and likely won’t
   provoke a single argument.” Kurt Refling of Meeple Mountain agrees:
   “The results are gut-bustingly funny.”

Best adult board GAME for Wordle fans

   Corsillo is also a fan of the board-GAME edition of Wordle. Designed
   with two players in mind, Wordle comes with 120 pages of blank grids so
   you can make up your own words while trying to stump your opponent,
   instead of relying on a randomized batch.

   Strategist contributor Lauren Guidry loves Dutch Blitz, which has been
   described as a kind of “very energetic solitaire.” Guidry calls the
   dopamine hit from a quick GAME “euphoric,” and says she’ll often
   persuade her husband to play a few hands between meetings when they are
   working from home together. Dutch Blitz can also be played solo.

   The party GAME we recommended as a gift for a “34-year-old neurosurgeon
   son who is into Magic: The Gathering.” The GAME is suitable for up to
   12 players and takes around a half hour to play. Players are split into
   two teams, with one player designated as the “psychic.” The team must
   move a needle to the correct position on a dial. The “psychic” knows
   where said target is and then selects a card with a scale. The psychic
   then must give the team a clue to try to get them to place the needle
   correctly. For example: where, on a scale from hot to cold, would you
   place coffee? If the team is able to interpret the clue and position
   the needle, they win a point. The first team to score ten points wins.

   As our friends over at Vulture put it: “I can’t think of the last time
   a new board GAME received the kind of widespread acclaim and mainstream
   attention as Wingspan, a GAME about birds and bird-watching that truly
   integrates its theme into gameplay and features beautiful artwork.” The
   GAME incorporates over 150 species of birds and asks players to collect
   the best birds to add to your aviary. It’s also a favorite among actual
   birders for its attention to detail and beautiful illustrations.

Best fast-paced card GAME for adults

   Bohnanza
   ‘Bohnanza’
   $20
   $20

   Strategist writer Lauren Ro, who admits she finds most board GAME
   “needlessly complicated and mind-numbingly boring,” says Bohnanza
   converted her from a GAME skeptic to an enthusiast. “It’s fun. It’s
   fast. The artwork is delightful. Best of all, it’s easy to learn, even
   for a dolt like me.” The concept is simple enough: Each player is a
   bean farmer who plants different varieties of beans; players harvest
   their crops in exchange for gold, and the more beans you harvest, the
   more coins you collect. However, the GAME dictates that you play with a
   fixed hand, meaning you have to play it in the order the cards were
   dealt or drawn, which makes things a bit more complicated since your
   hand dictates which bean you can plant in each field at each turn.
   Players must then barter with one another to trade beans, which adds
   elements of strategy and negotiation to the gameplay. “I didn’t think I
   could ever love a GAME, but this is the only one I actually look
   forward to playing and introducing to friends when there are four or
   more adults in my home,” Ro says.

   The Quacks of Quedlinburg is one of board-GAME enthusiast and
   Cartamundi tabletop GAME ambassador Sean Amdisen-Cooke’s “all-time
   favorite GAME” to play. “It’s a push-your-luck-style GAME where
   players draw blindly from their ingredient bags,” he says. Some
   ingredients will help you gain points and coins which you then spend on
   more resources. “But if you draw too many of the wrong ingredients,
   your pot will explode and you’ll have to make the hard choice between
   getting only victory points or coins,” which will put you behind your
   opponent, he explains.

   “Charterstone is a campaign-style GAME in which, over the course of 12
   GAME, you’ll build and expand a village shared by you and your
   opponents by constructing buildings and unlocking new elements with
   each play,” says Demers. “Consider it the board-GAME equivalent of a
   Netflix binge,” she adds, because you won’t be able to stop playing the
   GAME once you start. The branching storyline slowly grows more
   complicated, and by the end, after you’ve completed your 12-GAME
   campaign, “you will have a unique-to-you board GAME you can play again
   and again.”

   If you find battling a fictional pandemic soothing compared with living
   through one, Pandemic, Greg May, owner of the Uncommons and Hex &amp
   Company, calls it a “stellar cooperative GAME.” The main objective is
   for players to work together to stop the spread of four diseases and
   save the world. “This is considered a modern classic because it has a
   simple set of rules, it has a theme everyone can get into, and it is
   highly replayable,” adds Ronny Alexander of the cooperative board-GAME
   review site Co-op Board GAME.

   If you’re looking for a “quick, snappy” GAME that is easy to pick up,
   but “still has a bit of substance to it,” board-GAME blogger Eric Yurko
   suggests Cascadia. The goal of the GAME is to create a Pacific
   Northwest ecosystem by collecting different animals. And Yurko has one
   word to describe the work of GAME designer Randy Flynn: “exceptional.”

   According to Yurko, Carcassonne is a “classic,” which asks players to

   the complexity and fun come from its numerous expansions, making it a
   GAME you can play for years to come.

   ‘Patchwork’

   Patchwork, created by accomplished GAME designer Uwe Rosenberg, is one
   of the best two-player GAME for beginners. The GAME challenges players
   to strategically collect different pieces to create a quilt. May calls
   it “the perfect GAME for couples” that is sure to delight “fans of
   Blokus or Tetris.” Cooper adds that although the rules are simple to
   understand and it only takes about 15 minutes to play, the “subtle
   strategy keeps it interesting.” May agrees: “GAME are usually quite
   close, and there are just enough layers to keep you coming back without
   dragging things out.”

   Walsh also loves the party GAME Dixit, which he describes as “a great
   icebreaker of a GAME, fantastic for getting everyone interacting.” It
   begins with one player being designated the storyteller; that player
   makes up a sentence based on the image on one of the cards in their
   hand. Then each player selects the card in their hand that best matches
   the sentence and gives it to the storyteller. The storyteller shuffles
   the cards and presents them to the other players, who place bets on
   which is the original card with the winners gaining points for correct
   guesses. As an added bonus, “the card artwork is beautiful,
   imaginative, and sometimes a little surreal,” Walsh says.

   Another popular option is 7 Wonders, “a trading and resource-management

   ages of time,” explains Lee. “Efficiently building your civilization’s
   commercial routes, military, or technology can give you an edge in the

   Heron also recommends the “clever and beautiful” Parks, which he
   describes as “a wonderful, evocative hike through the National Park
   System of America.” Players take on the role of hikers as they navigate
   different trails, collecting memories of the different places they
   visit. The GAME is played in four rounds, each one representing one of
   the seasons with the trail tiles being rearranged before players begin
   the next round. The GAME features 48 unique illustrations from over 35
   artists, as well as 102 color-coded wood tokens that feature 12
   delicately carved animals native to the country’s parks.

   fantastical art and beautiful miniatures,” says May. Scythe takes place
   in a post-WWI dystopia where players have to vie for resources and
   land. Since the rules are complicated and the gameplay long, it’s a
   good option for serious gamers who are looking for a GAME to go on for

   Arkham Horror is “a rich storytelling experience filled with unique

   win or lose,” according to board-GAME designer Rob Sparks, who calls it
   “a great GAME to get lost in with a buddy.” It blends together a
   traditional card GAME with role-playing elements as players take on the
   roles of two investigators — each with their own set of strengths and
   weaknesses — who attempt to solve the GAME’s mysteries. “This
   experience of mystery and horror is totally worth your attention,” he
   promises.

     The Importance Of Rules In GAME

The Importance of Rules in GAME

   Whether you follow the rules that came with the GAME or make up your
   own rules, be sure that everyone agrees to them before the GAME begins.

The Importance of Rules in GAME

It's in the Cards

   A set of rules is a prescribed guide for conduct, telling you how to
   proceed with your next course of action.

   Rules, rules, rules! A GAME is only as good as its rules, and how well
   we play the GAME is defined by how well we follow the rules. What is so
   fascinating about many of the GAME we play today is that there are
   often no instruction books included—yet we somehow know how to play
   them anyway. We learn from family, friends, teachers, and coaches.

   In this article, we will take a look at why rules are important and how
   they can make playing GAME more enjoyable. It doesn't matter if you
   follow the rules that the GAME came with or if you make up your own
   rules; it really just matters that everyone agrees on what the rules
   are. We'll take a look at how to avoid trouble and keep the peace, be a
   good winner and a good loser, and how you can settle arguments that
   arise in the course of playing your GAME. By being clear on the rules
   of the GAME, you're sure to maximize your fun at all times!

Setting the Rules

   When I was a kid, we used to play a schoolyard GAME called
   Champ—otherwise known as Four Square. It was played in one large
   square, which was painted on the ground in our schoolyard. This square
   was divided into four smaller squares, with one square dedicated to the
   “Champ.” Because our square was a permanent one, all we needed to bring
   along was a very bouncy rubber ball.

   One person is the “Champ” and stands in the Champ's square. How you
   determine who becomes the Champ for the first GAME is up to the
   players. Here's some ideas for choosing a champ: You can flip a coin,
   pull straws, pick a number from one to ten and have the players guess
   it, or go alphabetically by first initial of first name. In our GAME,
   the Champ was the Champ until beaten by another player.

   The object is to keep the ball bouncing into each square using the palm
   of your hand. If you hit the ball outside the line, you are out and
   someone else takes your place in the square. The object is to get the
   Champ knocked out of the GAME, so you can move into the Champ's square.
   The Champ always goes first and has certain advantages over the other
   players in terms of scoring points and getting other players out. If
   another player unseats the Champ, he or she moves into that square with
   all its privileges and advantages.

   The most interesting thing that I remember about this GAME is that
   there was always at least one kid who knew the rules—and we made up
   many new rules as we went along. Sometimes the new rules stuck, and
   were passed on to the next group of kids. The rules were always
   announced at the beginning of recess and the GAME went on through
   recess. Sometimes we'd pick up where we left off the day before—we'd
   even mark our places in the waiting line. There was always a line;
   after all, only four people can play at a time.

High Score

   Create your own Champ playing field. Get a piece of washable chalk and
   draw the Champ grid on the pavement outside your house.

   When you decide to play any GAME, it's important to establish the rules
   in advance. Most board GAME come with their own instruction books, so
   that's easy enough. Read the rules aloud and discuss them as you go
   along so everyone knows what to expect when the GAME begins. There are
   many GAME that are passed down to us that have no written
   instructions. This book will help clear up the confusion on these
   GAME, so read on, and then read out loud.

   Setting the rules and getting everyone to agree on the rules is the
   first step to avoiding arguments when the competition has begun.
   Sometimes it's even fun to make up your own rules as you go along, but
   make sure that everyone is clear on what the rule changes are. That's
   the way to fair play. If you're a frequent player, keep a log of the
   rules handy, and add to this log as you redefine the GAME with new
   rules.

10.4 The Impact of Video GAME on Culture

Learning Objectives

    1. Describe gaming culture and how it has influenced mainstream
       culture.
    2. Analyze the ways video GAME have affected other forms of media.
    3. Describe how video GAME can be used for educational purposes.
    4. Identify the arguments for and against the depiction of video GAME
       as an art.

   An NPD poll conducted in 2007 found that 72 percent of the U.S.
   population had played a video GAME that year (Faylor, 2008). The
   increasing number of people playing video GAME means that video GAME
   are having an undeniable effect on culture. This effect is clearly
   visible in the increasing mainstream acceptance of aspects of gaming
   culture. Video GAME have also changed the way that many other forms of
   media, from music to film, are produced and consumed. Education has
   also been changed by video GAME through the use of new technologies
   that help teachers and students communicate in new ways through
   educational GAME such as Brain Age. As video GAME have an increasing
   influence on our culture, many have voiced their opinions on whether
   this form of media should be considered an art.

GAME Culture

   To fully understand the effects of video GAME on mainstream culture,
   it is important to understand the development of gaming culture, or the
   culture surrounding video GAME. Video GAME, like books or movies,
   have avid users who have made this form of media central to their
   lives. In the early 1970s, programmers got together in groups to play
   Spacewar!, spending a great deal of time competing in a GAME that was
   rudimentary compared to modern GAME (Brand). As video arcades and home
   video GAME consoles gained in popularity, youth culture quickly adapted
   to this type of media, engaging in competitions to gain high scores and
   spending hours at the arcade or with the home console.

   In the 1980s, an increasing number of kids were spending time on
   consoles playing GAME and, more importantly, increasingly identifying
   with the characters and products associated with the GAME. Saturday
   morning cartoons were made out of the Pac-Man and Super Mario Bros.
   GAME, and an array of nonGAME merchandise was sold with video GAME
   logos and characters. The public recognition of some of these
   characters has made them into cultural icons. A poll taken in 2007
   found that more Canadians surveyed could identify a photo of Mario,
   from Super Mario Bros., than a photo of the current Canadian prime
   minister (Cohn &amp Toronto, 2007).

   As the kids who first played Super Mario Bros. began to outgrow video
   GAME, companies such as Sega, and later Sony and Microsoft, began
   making GAME to appeal to older demographics. This has increased the
   average age of video GAME players, which was 35 in 2009 (Entertainment
   Software Association, 2009). The Nintendo Wii has even found a new
   demographic in retirement communities, where Wii Bowling has become a
   popular form of entertainment for the residents (Wischnowsky). The
   gradual increase in gaming age has led to an acceptance of video GAME
   as an acceptable form of mainstream entertainment.

The Subculture of Geeks

   The acceptance of video GAME in mainstream culture has consequently
   changed the way that the culture views certain people. “Geek” was the
   name given to people who were adept at technology but lacking in the
   skills that tended to make one popular, like fashion sense or athletic
   ability. Many of these people, because they often did not fare well in
   society, favored imaginary worlds such as those found in the fantasy
   and science fiction genres. Video GAME were appealing because they
   were both a fantasy world and a means to excel at something. Jim
   Rossignol, in his 2008 book This Gaming Life: Travels in Three Cities,
   explained part of the lure of playing Quake III online:

   Cold mornings, adolescent disinterest, and a nagging hip injury had
   meant that I was banished from the sports field for many years. I
   wasn’t going to be able to indulge in the camaraderie that sports teams
   felt or in the extended buzz of victory through dedication and
   cooperation. That entire swathe of experience had been cut off from me
   by cruel circumstance and a good dose of self-defeating apathy. Now,
   however, there was a possibility for some kind of redemption: a sport
   for the quick-fingered and the computer-bound; a space of possibility
   in which I could mold friends and strangers into a proficient gaming
   team (Rossignol, 2008).

   Video GAME gave a group of excluded people a way to gain proficiency
   in the social realm. As video GAME became more of a mainstream
   phenomenon and video GAME skills began to be desired by a large number
   of people, the popular idea of geeks changed. It is now common to see
   the term “geek” used to mean a person who understands computers and
   technology. This former slur is also prominent in the media, with
   headlines in 2010 such as “Geeks in Vogue: Top Ten Cinematic Nerds
   (Sharp, 2010).”

   Many media stories focusing on geeks examine the ways in which this
   subculture has been accepted by the mainstream. Geeks may have become
   “cooler,” but mainstream culture has also become “geekier.” The
   acceptance of geek culture has led to acceptance of geek aesthetics.
   The mainstreaming of video GAME has led to acceptance of fantasy or
   virtual worlds. This is evident in the popularity of film/book series
   such as The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. Comic book characters,
   emblems of geek culture, have become the vehicles for blockbuster
   movies such as Spider-Man and The Dark Knight. The idea of a fantasy or
   virtual world has come to appeal to greater numbers of people. Virtual
   worlds such as those represented in the Grand Theft Auto and Halo
   series and online GAME such as World of Warcraft have expanded the
   idea of virtual worlds so that they are not mere means of escape but
   new ways to interact (Konzack, 2006).

The Effects of Video GAME on Other Types of Media

   Video GAME during the 1970s and ’80s were often derivatives of other
   forms of media. E.T., Star Wars, and a number of other GAME took their
   cues from movies, television shows, and books. This began to change in
   the 1980s with the development of cartoons based on video GAME, and in
   the 1990s and 2000s with live-action feature films based on video
   GAME.

Television

   Television programs based on video GAME were an early phenomenon.
   Pac-Man, Pole Position, and Q*bert were among the animated programs
   that aired in the early 1980s. In the later 1980s, shows such as The
   Super Mario Bros. Super Show! and The Legend of Zelda promoted Nintendo
   GAME. In the 1990s, Pokémon, originally a GAME developed for the
   Nintendo GAME Boy, was turned into a television series, a card GAME,
   several movies, and even a musical (Internet Movie Database). Recently,
   several programs have been developed that revolve entirely around video
   GAME—the web series The Guild, for instance, tells the story of a
   group of friends who interact through an unspecified MMORPG.

   Nielsen, the company that tabulates television ratings, has begun
   rating video GAME in a similar fashion. In 2010, this information
   showed that video GAME, as a whole, could be considered a kind of
   fifth network, along with the television networks NBC, ABC, CBS, and
   Fox (Shields, 2009). Advertisers use Nielsen ratings to decide which
   programs to support. The use of this system is changing public
   perceptions to include video GAME playing as a habit similar to
   television watching.

   Video GAME have also influenced the way that television is produced.
   The Rocket Racing League, scheduled to be launched in 2011, will
   feature a “virtual racetrack.” Racing jets will travel along a virtual
   track that can only be seen by pilots and spectators with enabled
   equipment. Applications for mobile devices are being developed that
   will allow spectators to race virtual jets alongside the ones flying in
   real time (Hadhazy, 2010). This type of innovation is only possible
   with a public that has come to demand and rely on the kind of
   interactivity that video GAME provide.

Film

   The rise in film adaptations of video GAME accompanies the increased
   age of video GAME users. In 1995, Mortal Kombat, a live-action movie
   based on the video GAME, grossed over $70 million at the box office,
   placing it 22nd in the rankings for that year (Box Office Mojo). Lara
   Croft: Tomb Raider, released in 2001, starred well-known actress
   Angelina Jolie and ranked No. 1 at the box office when it was released,
   and 15th overall for the year (Box Office Mojo). Films based on video
   GAME are an increasingly common sight at the box office, such as
   producer Jerry Bruckheimer’s Prince of Persia, or the recent sequel to
   Tron, based on the idea of a virtual gaming arena.

   Another aspect of video GAME’ influence on films is how video GAME
   releases are marketed and perceived. The release date for anticipated
   GAME Grand Theft Auto IV was announced and marketed to compete with the
   release of the film Iron Man. Grand Theft Auto IV supposedly beat Iron
   Man by $300 million in sales. This kind of comparison is, in some ways,
   misleading. Video GAME cost much more than a ticket to a movie, so
   higher sales does not mean that more people bought the GAME than the
   movie. Also, the distribution apparatus for the two media is totally
   different. Movies can only be released in theaters, whereas video GAME
   can be sold at any retail outlet (Associated Press, 2008). What this
   kind of news story proves, however, is that the general public
   considers video GAME as something akin to a film. It is also important
   to realize that the scale of production and profit for video GAME is
   similar to that of films. Video GAME include music scores, actors, and
   directors in addition to the GAME designers, and the budgets for major
   GAME reflect this. Grand Theft Auto IV cost an estimated $100 million
   to produce (Bowditch, 2008).

Music

   Video GAME have been accompanied by music ever since the days of the
   arcade. Video GAME music was originally limited to computer beeps
   turned into theme songs. The design of the Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn,
   and Sony PlayStation made it possible to use sampled audio on new
   GAME, meaning songs played on physical instruments could be recorded
   and used on video GAME. Beginning with the music of the Final Fantasy
   series, scored by famed composer Nobuo Uematsu, video GAME music took
   on film score quality, complete with full orchestral and vocal tracks.
   This innovation proved beneficial to the music industry. Well-known
   musicians such as Trent Reznor, Thomas Dolby, Steve Vai, and Joe
   Satriani were able to create the soundtracks for popular GAME, giving
   these artists exposure to new generations of potential fans (Video
   GAME Music Big Hit, 1997). Composing music for video GAME has turned
   into a profitable means of employment for many musicians. Schools such
   as Berklee College of Music, Yale, and New York University have
   programs that focus on composing music for video GAME. The students
   are taught many of the same principles that are involved in film
   scoring (Khan, 2010).

   Many rock bands have allowed their previously recorded songs to be used
   in video GAME, similar to a hit song being used on a movie soundtrack.
   The bands are paid for the rights to use the song, and their music is
   exposed to an audience that otherwise might not hear it. As mentioned
   earlier, GAME like Rock Band and Guitar Hero have been used to promote
   bands. The release of The Beatles: Rock Band was timed to coincide with
   the release of digitally remastered reissues of the Beatles’ albums.

   Another phenomenon relating to music and video GAME involves musicians
   covering video GAME music. A number of bands perform only video GAME
   covers in a variety of styles, such as the popular Japanese group the
   Black Mages, which performs rock versions of Final Fantasy music.
   Playing video GAME themes is not limited to rock bands, however. An
   orchestra and chorus called Video GAME Live started a tour in 2005
   dedicated to playing well-known video GAME music. Their performances
   are often accompanied by graphics projected onto a screen showing
   relevant sequences from the video GAME (Play Symphony).

Machinima

   Recently, the connection between video GAME and other media has
   increased with the popularity of machinima, animated films and series
   created by recording character actions inside video GAME. Beginning
   with the short film “Diary of a Camper,” filmed inside the GAME Quake
   in 1996, fans of video GAME have adopted the technique of machinima to
   tell their own stories. Although these early movies were released only
   online and targeted a select niche of gamers, professional filmmakers
   have since adopted the process, using machinima to storyboard scenes
   and to add a sense of individuality to computer-generated shots. This
   new form of media is increasingly becoming mainstream, as TV shows such
   as South Park and channels such as MTV2 have introduced machinima to a
   larger audience (Strickland).

Video GAME and Education

   image

   Figure 10.7 Educational video GAME have proven to be useful tools for
   educators.

   One sign of the mainstreaming of video GAME is the increase of
   educational institutions that embrace them. As early as the 1980s,
   GAME such as Number Munchers and Word Munchers were designed to help
   children develop basic math and grammar skills. In 2006, the Federation
   of American Scientists completed a study that approved of video GAME
   use in education. The study cited the fact that video GAME systems were
   present in most households, kids favored learning through video GAME,
   and GAME could be used to facilitate analytical skills (Feller, 2006).
   Another study, published in the science journal Nature in 2002, found
   that regular video GAME players had better developed visual-processing
   skills than people who did not play video GAME. Participants in the
   test were asked to play a first-person shooter GAME for 1 hour a day
   for 10 days, and were then tested for specific visual attention skills.
   The playing improved these skills in all participants, but the regular
   video GAME players had a greater skill level than the non–GAME players.
   According to the study, “Although video-GAME playing may seem to be
   rather mindless, it is capable of radically altering visual attention
   processing (Green &amp Bavelier, 2003).”

   Other educational institutions have begun to embrace video GAME as
   well. The Boy Scouts of America have created a “belt loop,” something
   akin to a merit badge, for tasks including learning to play a
   parent-approved GAME and developing a schedule to balance video GAME
   time with homework (Murphy, 2010). The federal government has also seen
   the educational potential of video GAME. A commission on balancing the
   federal budget suggested a video GAME that would educate Americans
   about the necessary costs of balancing the federal budget (Wolf, 2010).
   The military has similarly embraced video GAME as training simulators
   for new soldiers. These simulators, working off of newer GAME
   technologies, present several different realistic options that soldiers
   could face on the field. The GAME have also been used as recruiting
   tools by the U.S. Army and the Army National Guard (Associated Press,
   2003).

   The ultimate effect of video GAME use for education, whether in schools
   or in the public arena, means that video GAME have been validated by
   established cultural authorities. Many individuals still resist the
   idea that video GAME can be beneficial or have a positive cultural
   influence, but their embrace by educational institutions has given
   video GAME validation.

Video GAME as Art

   While universally accepted as a form of media, a debate has recently
   arisen over whether video GAME can be considered a form of art. Roger
   Ebert, the well-known film critic, has historically argued that “video
   GAME can never be art,” citing the fact that video GAME are meant to
   be won, whereas art is meant to be experienced (Ebert, 2010).

   His remarks have generated an outcry from both video gamers and
   developers. Many point to GAME such as 2009’s Flower, in which players
   control the flow of flower petals in the wind, as examples of video
   GAME developing into art. Flower avoids specific plot and characters
   to allow the player to focus on interaction with the landscape and the
   emotion of the GAME-play (That GAME Company). Likewise, more mainstream
   GAME such as the popular Katamari series, released in 2004, are built
   around the idea of creation, requiring players to pull together a
   massive clump of objects in order to create a star.

   Video GAME, once viewed as a mindless source of entertainment, are now
   being featured in publications such as The New Yorker magazine and The
   New York Times (Fisher, 2010). With the development of increasingly
   complex musical scores and the advent of machinima, the boundaries
   between video GAME and other forms of media are slowly blurring. While
   they may not be considered art by everyone, video GAME have
   contributed significantly to modern artistic culture.

Key Takeaways

     * The aesthetics and principles of gaming culture have had an
       increasing effect on mainstream culture. This has led to the
       gradual acceptance of marginalized social groups and increased
       comfort with virtual worlds and the pursuit of new means of
       interaction.
     * Video GAME have gone from being a derivative medium that took its
       cues from other media, such as books, films, and music, to being a
       form of media that other types derive new ideas from. Video GAME
       have also interacted with older forms of media to change them and
       create new means of entertainment and interaction.
     * Educational institutions have embraced the use of video GAME as
       valuable tools for teaching. These tools include simulated worlds
       in which important life skills can be learned and improved.
     * While video GAME may not be accepted by everyone as a form of art,
       there is no doubt that they contribute greatly to artistic media
       such as music and film.

Exercises

   Think about the ways in which video GAME have influenced and affected
   other forms of media. Then consider the following questions:
    1. Are there things video GAME will never be able to offer?
    2. Write down several examples of ways in which other forms of media
       are not replicated by video GAME. Then speculate on ways video
       GAME could eventually emulate these forms.

   Digital Advertising Trends  |  August 25, 2022July 11, 2023

4 Reasons Why You Should Be Advertising in Video GAME

   Erin Hynes

   There will be 179.6 million monthly gamers in the US this year—meaning
   more than half of the US population will identify as digital gamers by
   the end of 2022.

   Gamers are now nearly synonymous with everyday consumers, and it’s time
   for advertisers to pay attention. Advertising in video GAME, also
   known as in-GAME advertising, will help you tap into a growing and
   engaged audience.

   This upward trend points to the growing opportunity to reach engaged
   audiences through video GAME ads. In-GAME advertising leverages
   programmatic to enable ads to appear in mobile, computer, and video
   GAME. With blended in-GAME, ads are seamlessly integrated, so they
   don’t interrupt gameplay.

What Are In-GAME Ads

   Blended in-GAME ads appear on in-GAME objects such as billboards,
   walls, jerseys, and more during gameplay. The goal of blended in-GAME
   advertising is to insert ads that get noticed while not interrupting
   the player’s enjoyment of the GAME.

   They are non-intrusive, highly-viewable and drive high brand recall.
   Blended in-GAME ads can be delivered through programmatic advertising
   on gaming consoles, mobile devices, or on PCs.

   Blended in-GAME inventory can be run at scale across impactful
   suppliers and platforms around the world.

What Are Two Common Blended In-GAME Ad Units

   The most common formats that are leveraged in a blended in-GAME ad
   campaign are display and video ads. Let’s break them down:

In-GAME Display Ads

   Display ads are typically a designed image or a photo combined with
   copy. They should be eye-catching enough to attract the attention of a
   gamer, and they should deliver a quick message.

   Since display ads are often small, it’s important to clearly
   communicate a single message with a strong call to action (CTA). Note
   that CTAs cannot be clickable, so be sure to communicate concisely to
   the user how they can engage with your brand further.

Blended In-GAME Video Ads

   Video advertising is a great way to create an emotional connection to
   your brand. Since it’s a visual medium, it’s important to focus on a
   narrative that demonstrates your larger brand story.

   Rather than telling the audience why you’re the best product or service
   for them, show them how your values align with theirs.

4 Benefits of Advertising in Video GAME

   In-GAME advertising offers an opportunity to reach a growing and
   diverse audience. But, this isn’t the only benefit of leveraging this
   channel.

1. Reach a diverse audience of gamers.

   There isn’t a “one size fits all” for a typical gamer. Gaming audiences
   are incredibly diverse in their demographics. For example, a 2021 study
   showed that 55% of gamers identified as male, and 45% identified as
   female, and that most gamers range in age across a few generations
   (Source: Anzu, Q4 2021).

   Gamers are diverse in their consumer purchasing habits, too. Some may
   be working professionals with expendable income, who are interested in
   the latest tech products. Others might be parents who are open to back
   to school messaging. The bottom line is that the gaming audience is
   diverse in their demographics, interests, and purchase intentions.

2. Leverage in-GAME ads to build brand awareness.

   In-GAME advertising helps you reach your target user in a
   non-disruptive, highly-viewable environment. You’re able to connect
   your brand with a captive audience who is unlikely to be multitasking,
   which increases the likelihood of brand recall and awareness.

   Building brand awareness is a valuable benefit of in-GAME ads because
   it helps you get closer to achieving a range of business objectives and
   goals. Brand awareness can expand your audience, increase website
   traffic, increase brand affinity, and drive consumers further down the
   purchasing funnel.

3. Reach influential users who are playing video GAME.

   Gamers are savvy and influential. According to Anzu research, 51% of
   gamers advise others and 47% influence others. And, 46% try to be the
   first to know about new stuff, like emerging tech and new fashion.

   Advertising in video GAME enables you to reach influential gaming
   audiences in an emerging industry. And, gamers have spending power;
   those who play 10+ hours a week have 2x more disposable income than
   non-gamers.

4. Explore new programmatic advertising strategies.

   In-GAME advertising provides the opportunity to test unique ad formats
   that are exclusive to in-GAME environments. Plus, you can reach new
   audiences through emerging technologies.

   With this format, it’s important to optimize your ads for the gaming
   environment in order to maximize exposure and capture the attention of
   users. Creatives should be tailored to an in-GAME environment, so that
   the messaging fits within an in-GAME context.

Start Advertising in Video GAME

   Are you ready to get into the GAME? By leveraging in-GAME advertising,
   you can reap the many benefits of this growing channel. You’ll reach a
   diverse and engaged audience, with an opportunity to build brand
   awareness.

   Advertising in video GAME is on the rise, and so now is the time to
   add it to your media mix. Get ahead of the GAME by testing in-GAME
   advertising strategies, now!

2. Play-to-Earn GAME Apps

   Several smartphone apps let you make money playing video GAME in your
   spare time. Here are a few of Side Hustle Nation’s top picks.

Rewarded Play (Android)

   With over 180,000 reviews and a 4.4-star rating in the Google Play
   store, Rewarded Play is another free, legit, and fun, “get paid to
   play” app.

   rewarded play app

   Rewarded Play is your one-stop app for casual GAME like Solitaire,
   Mahjong, Wheel of Fortune, Yahtzee, and more. As you play, choose your
   rewards and get your gift cards within 48 hours.

Bingo Cash

   The popular Bingo Cash GAME app turns classic bingo from a GAME of luck
   into a GAME of speed and skill.

   Each GAME only takes about 2 minutes to play, and you can earn
   real-world rewards and cash prizes (except in AR, IA, LA, SC, and WA).

   bingo cash app

   With over 5 million downloads, the app has earned mostly positive
   reviews (players call it fun and addicting). In the negative App Store
   reviews, the most common complaint is that the ads claiming you can win
   big money with little effort are misleading.

   As with all gaming apps, practice for free first. Then, never put more
   money at risk than you can afford to lose.

Solitaire Cash

   I played my fair share of Windows Solitaire growing up, so Solitaire
   Cash got my attention.

   solitaire cash app

   The well-rated Android and iOS (4.6-stars from over 250k App Store
   reviews) GAME app pits you against similarly-skilled solitaire players.
   Everyone receives the same deck, and top 3 players who finish with the
   most points win.

   Of course, I recommend practicing for free first!

   Solitaire Cash is free to download and play, but real money tournaments
   aren’t yet available in AZ, IN, IO, LA, ME, MT, SC, and WA.

Mistplay (Android)

   With more than 10 million downloads, Mistplay is an interesting app
   that rewards you for discovering and playing new GAME on your phone.

   mistplay app

   The more you play, the more “units” you earn. Then you can cash in
   those units for gift cards to your favorite stores.

   Check out the GAME with 3x or 4x unit “multipliers” to earn gift cards
   faster.

3. Video GAME Testing

   Before video GAME get released to the general public, they go through
   quite a bit of play testing. This is where your vast experience comes
   into play!

   Knowing how a great GAME should work and providing that feedback to the
   developers can be super valuable.

   If you like GAME apps on your phone, KashKick may be worth a look. At
   press time, they were offering $90-120 to play certain GAME and reach
   specific milestones.

   Check out our full KashKick review to learn more.

   Similarly, Cash Giraffe (Android only) connects you with new GAME that
   are trying to attract more players. The app tracks the time you spend
   playing and rewards you for hitting certain milestones.

   As you earn more Cash Giraffe tickets, you can cash out for gift cards
   or deposit directly into your PayPal account.

   While Cash Giraffe is relatively new, it’s earned positive feedback so
   far. With over 5M downloads, its rated 4.3-stars on the Google Play
   Store.

   In addition, some people actually turn GAME testing into their career!
   Most GAME companies hire quality assurance (QA) testers to spot bugs
   and other issues with GAME before they go on sale.

   A quick search on Indeed found a number of job postings with salaries
   ranging from $30,000-85,000 a year.

4. Video GAME Coaching

   Video GAME coaching is a great option if you have a deep understanding
   and passion for specific GAME.

   You can instruct other gamers through tutorials, screen-sharing
   walkthroughs, and group classes. Wouldn’t it be cool to get paid to
   share your tips, tricks, and advice?

   On platforms like Gamer Sensei, you can set your own rates (typically
   $30/hour and up) and availability. But not all coaches who apply get
   accepted. While this keeps quality high on the platform, it can be
   discouraging if you’re just starting out.

   An alternative would be to set up some coaching gigs on Fiverr for your
   favorite GAME, or try and find clients locally.

   When creating your profile, put yourself in your potential customer’s
   shoes. Why should they hire you? What video GAME credentials do you
   have?

   Your rates will vary based on your experience, the popularity of the
   GAME, and competition.

   Most video GAME coaches charge by the hour — usually in the
   $20-200/hour range. However, you could earn even more with group
   classes.

5. All Skill Level Video GAME Tournaments

   You’ve probably heard of elite gamers winning big prize money from
   top-level video GAME tournaments. GameChampions lets players of all
   skill levels in on the excitement.

   get paid to play video GAME with gamechampions

   They use a “Fair Play Guarantee” to match you with players of similar
   skill, and have paid out over $10 million in prizes so far.

   GameChampions is open to players 18 and older, but play-to-win money
   GAME aren’t available in all geographic areas. The company will give
   you a $5 sign-up bonus when you create your account.

6. Video GAME Reporting

   Another way to make money through your love of playing video GAME is
   to become a video GAME journalist.

   The role involves reporting on video GAME news, upcoming GAME, writing
   GAME reviews, and even reporting from e-sport tournaments.

   The two most common paths to get paid here are either as a staff writer
   for a gaming publication or as a freelancer. Your earning potential
   ranges from from $26,000 to $100,000 a year depending on your
   experience, writing skills, and portfolio.

7. Start a Video GAME YouTube Channel

   YouTube is still a popular platform that you can make money playing
   video GAME. Several avid gamers have created their own YouTube channel
   and stream their live gameplay or broadcast recorded videos that rely
   on followers and subscribers.

   Video GAME Coaching, Reporting, And Testing

   In addition to streaming, you can create:
    1. gameplay tutorials
    2. engaging video GAME reviews
    3. helpful gameplay tips

   Followers can recommend you to their gaming friends and the revenue can
   quickly become substantial. Video GAME YouTubers monetize with a
   combination of:
     * YouTube ad income
     * Affiliate marketing
     * Brand partnerships and sponsorships
     * Viewer support and donations
     * Merchandise and product sales

   Typical advertising income for video GAME channels may be $3-5 for
   every 1,000 views. With a popular channel, that can add up fast!

   Another common monetization strategy on YouTube is to make product
   recommendations, and use your affiliate link in the description. That
   way, you’ll earn a commission when anyone buys through your link.

8. Stream on Twitch

   Twitch has become one of the most popular sites for gaming across the
   globe. It’s the go-to site for video gamers to earn money streaming
   their gameplay.

   As your following grows, you’ll start to earn subscription and donation
   revenue. Top streamers make 6- and even 7-figures a year!

   Twitch works best if you’re either very good at a certain GAME, and/or
   very entertaining to follow. Remember, you’re competing your followers’
   for limited attention, so the content needs to be really compelling.

   And similar to YouTube, as you gain trust and build a relationship with
   your audience you can monetize with donations, merch, brand deals, and
   more.

9. Crypto Gaming

   The rise of cryptocurrency and NFTs have opened up another revenue
   stream for video gamers.

   For example, in Axie Infinity, gamers raise, trade, and battle NFT pets
   known as Axies. As you level up, your characters become more and more
   valuable — and can be bought and sold.

   The in-GAME currency, Axie Infinity Shards, can then be bought or sold
   on exchanges like Coinbase.

   Crypto gaming is definitely an area to keep an eye on.

10. Create Video GAME Guides

   Years ago, a friend of mine was making thousands of dollars a month
   selling a Minecraft guide on Amazon. He’d self-published the book, had
   no audience, but people searching “Minecraft” on Amazon found it and
   bought it.

   Video GAME guides or tutorials can show others how to complete tricky
   levels or improve their gameplay. It’s another way to convert your
   expertise into cash.

   After you’ve created the guides, you can post them on your social
   media, upload them to YouTube, or sell the whole bundle as an online
   course.

   This isn’t a video GAME example, but may still be relevant. Kat Norton
   created TikTok tutorials on how to use Excel better. Those went viral,
   and she ended up putting together an in-depth training program on Excel
   and other Microsoft products. (And turned those into a wildly
   profitable business!)

   Could you do the same for your favorite GAME?

11. Sell Merchandise

   As a gamer, you you know that a love of video GAME can be part of your
   identity. That’s why GAME-themed or GAME-inspired merch can be such a
   hit.

   If you have some design skills, take a look at sites like Etsy and
   Redbubble to see what’s selling. You may not be allowed to use licensed
   characters in your design, but you can get creative to sell other
   products gamers would love.

   make money selling video GAME merch on redbubble

   Thanks to print on demand technology, you don’t have to carry any
   inventory or deal with shipping. Simply upload your designs, set your
   prices, and the platforms take care of the rest.

   Another angle would be to partner with popular streamers to make merch
   for their fans. Do they have a particular inside joke or catchphrase
   that would make a fun shirt? Reach out with your design samples and see
   if they’d be open to splitting revenue with you.

12. Build Your Own Video GAME or App

   How cool would it be to have your own popular GAME on the App Store? If
   you don’t have coding or GAME design experience, you can learn from
   top-rated courses like this one.

   Developers earn a 70% royalty on any sales of the app or in-app
   purchases. For a popular GAME, that can turn into a serious income
   stream.

   Sometimes the biggest hits are the simplest. Take Wordle for example,
   where you have 6 chances to guess a 5-letter word. Creator Josh Wardle
   sold it to The New York Times just a few months after starting it for
   more than $1 million!

   Should the proposal be a hit, you can use your own gaming skills to
   develop the GAME you have always wanted to play.

13. Be a Video GAME Developer

   Be A Video GAME Developer

   Your skills as a gamer can also be used behind the scenes as a video
   GAME developer. Becoming part of the video GAME industry itself can be
   a lucrative career choice and a video GAME developer is an in-demand
   skill.

   In this role, you’ll be responsible for turning GAME ideas into reality
   through code and collaboration. Plus, per ZipRecruiter, GAME developers
   earn an average of $100,000 a year.

14. Teach Video GAME Design

   If you already have some experience in how video GAME are made, you
   could turn around and teach others. Instructors can make money teaching
   video GAME design techniques and basic coding vocabulary and concepts.

   If you like working with kids, take a look at Outschool. Here you’ll
   create an engaging class for future GAME designers and developers.

   If your content is better for adults, you might create a pre-recorded
   class for Udemy or Skillshare. For every student who joins, you’ll earn
   a small royalty, with top instructors earning thousands of dollars a
   month.

15. Be a Professional Gamer

   Do you have the skills to go pro? There are video GAME tournaments
   across the globe, often with serious prize money on the line.

   Choose a GAME you know you’re great at, look for some local or online
   tournaments to get experience, and keep leveling up.

   While elite-level gamers earn millions of dollars, the majority are
   just scraping by. This is similar to professional sports or acting,
   where the average income is quite low, but the pursuit of getting paid
   to do what you love is a huge draw.

16. Become an E-Sports Star

   ESports — short for electronic sports — is a form of competition where
   you can earn prizes by playing video GAME.

   The typical format involves professional players that compete against
   each other individually or as part of a team in a multiplayer contest.
   The increasing popularity of esports has a lot to do with how streaming
   has developed in the last decade or so.

   As more gamers want to see competitions featuring their favorite GAME,
   more GAME developers have started competitions to showcase their GAME
   and provide funding for those tournaments.

   Typically, the GAME that are involved in competitions are first-person
   shooters, multiplayer online battle arenas, battle royale, fighting,
   real-time strategy, and sports.

   If you excel in competition and need to push the boundaries in a
   particular GAME or format then there are several e-sport franchises to
   choose from. These include Dota, Counter-Strike, League of Legends,
   Valorant, Overwatch, Super Smash Bros., StarCraft, and Street Fighter.

   Huge tournaments like the League of Legends World Championship and
   Intel Extreme Masters attract a big audience and even bigger paydays
   for the winners.

Getting Paid to Pay Video GAME: Final Thoughts

   You can turn your love of video GAME into a money-making hobby. There
   are opportunities to get paid:
     * playing
     * coaching
     * reviewing
     * streaming
     * testing
     * developing
     * teaching
     * and more

   Which option is right for you depends on your unique skills, interests,
   and goals. But one thing is certain: the days of your parents telling
   you that playing video GAME is a waste of time are over!

Frequently Asked Questions

How Can I Get Sponsors For My Video GAME Playing?

   Once you establish a following for your video GAME playing, consider

   the popularity and quality of your content on YouTube or Twitch.

How Much Do Customer Service Representatives Make When Working For Video GAME
Companies?

       One of the apps that let me earn a decent amount of money is
       Paidwork. I’ve found it a couple months ago, I believe back when
       it’s name was still Zareklamy. Anyway, the app has a huge following
       and great amount of positive ratings. You can earn money in
       Paidwork by playing mobile GAME, filling surveys, watching videos,
       creating accounts and doing online shopping. I’d recommend it
       myself to at least give it a try, I’ve tried and I’m happy about it
       :D

       Great list once again!
       I would add few apps though that enable you to earn more:
       – Benjamin (they are available for iOS too): with Benjamin you can
       earn money from playing GAME and doing surveys. Kind of like a mix
       of Mistplay, RewardedPlay and Surveyjunkie. It pays better than any
       of those apps though.
       -Fiver: Sign up as a logo making artist, then add the description
       your client gives to you to a chatgpt and tell chatgpt DALL-e to
       design the logo – vola! Easy $20.

   Due to the popularity and advancement of 4G/5G networks, mobile GAME
   have already currently become profitable tools for major internet
   platforms. These GAME are even refined to cover almost all age groups
   of the population rather than the young people. Yet in the perception
   of the public, mobile GAME have always seemed to be associated with
   various derogatory terms such as interfering with learning, addiction,
   and violence. K12 students usually have less self-control capability,
   and they are undoubtedly the biggest advocates of mobile GAME. This
   paper summarizes the technological development of mobile GAME from the
   aspects of hardware and software in chronological order. The
   psychological and social problems that mobile GAME have brought to K12
   students are analyzed from a neutral perspective. At the end of the
   paper, the future development of educational GAME and current
   limitations of mobile GAME are also given for the explorations of
   future trends of GAME-based education. This position paper aims to
   provide the insight of what psychosocial impacts that the current
   mobile GAME have on the student, and it may also serve as a reference
   for the how the GAME-based education has been developing according to
   the mobile technology wise.

Introduction

   Due to the popularity of smart terminals and the advancement of 5G
   networks, mobile GAME are currently the most popular type of GAME, as
   well as profitable tools for major internet platforms. Mobile GAME can
   be combined from different levels and content categories, covering
   different, personalities and preferences (Martin et al., 2020). As a
   result mobile GAME are now refined to cover almost all age groups of
   the population, not just young people. Yet in the perception of the
   public, mobile GAME have always seemed to be associated with various
   derogatory terms such as interfering with learning, addiction and
   violence.

   K12 students are refer to the students in the age group from
   Kindergarten (usually 5–6 years old) to Grade 12 (usually 17–18 years
   old) (Kurt et al., 2022). Students in this age group usually have less
   self-control capability, and they are undoubtedly the biggest advocates
   of mobile GAME. When they play certain GAME for long periods of time
   their behavior and psychological state will be changed in a subtle way.
   The main issue is that mobile GAME may contain unhealthy contents such
   as pornography, violence, ignorance, superstition, etc. which
   implicitly affect the formation of the correct value system and the
   healthy development of their body and mind for these K12 students
   (Destyanto et al., 2017). In addition, some young people indulge in
   mobile GAME due to lack of self-control, which not only result in
   harmful influence on their studies but also induces a series of
   negative social activities and social relationship (Kurt et al., 2022).

   The pioneers of communication science, Lazarsfeld and Merton, argued
   that modern mass media have a clear negative function of
   “psychoanesthesia.” Some violent mobile GAME reveal the nature of the
   “psychoanesthesia” function in another textual dimension: they create
   illusions through inexpensive and negative entertainment, thus eating
   away at the social mobility of those young people in an implicit
   cultural way (Kurt et al., 2022). Craig Anderson found that the
   “psychoanesthetic” mechanism of violent mobile GAME increases the
   physiological arousal of aggressive behavior, cognition, emotions, and
   violent impulses, and reduces pro-social behavior in adolescents
   (Elsherbiny and Al Maamari, 2021; Kurt et al., 2022). Accordingly,
   violent behavior has become the main “product component” of mobile
   GAME “inflicted” on adolescents. Moreover, its basic social
   manifestations can be summarized in four points: firstly, it creates
   and activates networks of thinking related to violent aggression;
   secondly, it weakens the inhibition process of violence; thirdly, the
   GAME’s violent reward rules allow aggressive behavior to be imitated
   and reinforced in the “mimetic environment;” and fourthly, the binary
   values of right and wrong in GAME can reduce young people’s empathy
   (Elsherbiny and Al Maamari, 2021).

   Mobile GAME do not only imply a behavior, but also contain a value,
   which might be sometimes anti-social in nature. Violent mobile GAME on
   the Internet may portray the grandeur, hooliganism, and banditry of
   triad bosses and gangsters, contributing to the psychology of
   adolescent violence. In particular, the propaganda of “materialism” in
   violent online GAME can easily lead young people to abandon their
   original morals and values, so that the “money first” mentality
   gradually seeps into their minds and leads to a distorted way of
   thinking and personality.

   This position paper therefore infer the future development of
   educational GAME from existing mobile GAME, and shares some insights
   into the current limitations, and critically analyses the above issues
   from a neutral perspective, discusses the psychological impacts and
   social problems that mobile GAME may cause for K12 students (Arteaga
   et al., 2012). It also offers the future development of mobile GAME
   and the limitations of current educational GAME in order to explore
   future trends in gamified education. This paper can also be considered
   as a reference on how gamified education is evolving in light of mobile
   technology.

Technological Development of Mobile GAME

From Feature Phone to Smartphone

   Nowadays, almost everyone who owns a smartphone has been exposed to
   mobile GAME at one time or another. It may be a mini-GAME embedded in
   a web page or app, or a large 3D online GAME like “Arena of Alor” or
   “Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds” (De Gloria et al., 2014). These GAME
   have a huge update from the mobile GAME of over a decade ago, both in
   scale and in audio and video experience. And most mobile phones now
   have larger screens and touch screens have become the main way to use
   mobile phones, which did not exist on the same level mobile phones in
   10 years ago, which has promoted the development of mobile GAME
   (Rubino et al., 2015).

   The continuous evolution of cell phone hardware has brought about a
   constant change in the needs of gamers. There was a time when the only
   requirement for gamers was that their phones could run a particular
   GAME, but now gamers want smoother GAME, no lag when playing online,
   and even want their phones to be able to turn on the highest picture
   quality of the GAME (Ma et al., 2019). This means that the hardware
   that provides key performance in the phone and the network environment
   that the phone relies on also needs to evolve to meet the increasingly
   diverse needs of gamers (Wang et al., 2020). Gradually, mobile phones
   and mobile GAME have worked together to promote growth and form the
   industry shape we see today. In addition to entertainment, mobile GAME
   also carry part of people’s social needs in their daily lives (Yang and
   Gong, 2021).

   Twenty years ago, the average person was still using 2G networks and
   physical button phones were just starting to become popular (Jang et
   al., 2019). At the time, most phones only had a black and white screen
   of about 1 inch, and due to system and network capacity limitations,
   only the GAME built into the phone could be played, such as Snake,
   Tetris, etc (Figure 1). These were indeed interesting, but they were
   just ordinary GAME to kill the time.
   FIGURE 1
   www.frontiersin.org

   Figure 1. Representative mobile GAME from 1994 to 2019.

   After 2003, color screen cell phones and PDAs began to occupy the
   consumers’ vision, the hardware performance of cell phones began to
   improve, the software and system functions were gradually enriched. At
   the same time, electronic GAME began to appear on cell phones in
   various forms (Syahrivar et al., 2022). Since Symbian had strict limits
   on the resolution and number of threads for software development, and
   J2ME development had a maximum memory limit, the vast majority of
   mobile GAME did not exceed 1 MB in size until the new Symbian system
   appeared in 2006, when these restrictions were lifted one by one (de
   Byl, 2014).

   The popularity of color-screened phones allowed GAME developers to see
   the opportunity, and some very well-known GAME such as Need for Speed,
   Call of Duty, Command and Conquer, and many others launched dedicated
   mobile versions (Berlo et al., 2020). Many small development teams and
   enthusiasts also developed board GAME such as chess, Texas hold’em
   into mobile versions. A variety of mobile phone native GAME began to
   appear at this time, such as “Tower Bloxx” and “Galaxy on Fire” in 2005
   were enjoyable for handheld gamers at the time (Haney, 2017). Around
   2005, when client-side mobile GAME were just exploding, there were
   already many specialized GAME makers developing mobile GAME for
   non-smartphones, but limited by the speed and stability of cell phone
   networks, and they were eagerly anticipating the popularity of 3G and
   4G, but failed to foresee the rapid explosion of smartphones (Sosins,
   2013; Manning and Buttfield-Addison, 2017; Papadakis, 2021).

From Keyboard to Touch Screen

   In 2008, with the birth of iOS and Android, Apple successfully
   pioneered the touch screen cell phone, after the mobile GAME from the
   constraints of the physical keyboard, such as “Angry Birds,” “Plants
   vs. Zombies,” “Fruit Ninja,” “Temple Run” and a series of new hand
   quickly occupied the market share in 1 year (Vaiopoulou et al., 2021).
   The introduction of Angry Birds made the public realize for the first
   time that the era of mobile GAME may be coming (Kalogiannakis et al.,
   2022).

   “Angry Birds”, developed by Rovio and launched in 2009, is another
   phenomenal product. Throughout the GAME, gamers only need to do one
   action, which is to press and hold the bird on the slingshot in the
   screen to drag and release (Villasana et al., 2020). Such a simple
   operation overturned the public’s inherent impression of how mobile
   GAME are presented, so Fruit Ninja and Cut the Rope, launched a year
   later, both became star products at the time for their sophisticated
   gameplay design and simple sliding operation (Thomas et al., 2019). Few
   people may know that the first release of the GAME Doodle Jump in 2009
   was developed for touchscreen phones, and only a year later came a
   version that supported physical button phones. That’s because around
   2010, the popularity of large-screen touch phones with smart systems
   made a radical change in the way mobile GAME were operated (Thomas et
   al., 2019).

   The birth of the iPhone and the resulting trend in the use of touch
   screen created not only revolutionized the user’s experience of
   operating cell phones, but also made hand GAME free from the
   limitations of the physical keyboard, with new operation ways of
   playing other than “up, down, left and right” (Škařupová et al., 2016).
   If we say that the high price of iPhone may to a certain extent prevent
   the further expansion of the user scale of smartphones, Android is
   waiting for the opportunity to fill the gap to complete the last blow
   of smart phones to feature phones (Ghosh et al., 2018).

   Take iOS as an example, App Store is the only (or the main) channel
   value, hand GAME developers still have the leisure of “slow work, fine
   work,” but by the limitation of iPhone ownership, the income of
   developers at this time is much shabbier compared with today (Bagaa et
   al., 2018). For example, in 2011, the highest-grossing handheld GAME in
   China was “World War II Storm,” and its monthly flow was only $800,000
   (Paseka and Schwab, 2020).

   In 2010, Google announced its withdrawal from China because of its
   refusal to censor content. Although Android as an operating system was
   not affected much, but as we all know, Google Play, a connected
   service, was given the risk of instability (Liu et al., 2020). The
   reason why smart phones are “smart” is that they allow users to obtain
   applications through channels and support users to freely configure
   applications in hardware terminals, when the official channels of
   Android are covered with a layer of haze, coupled with the unique
   openness of Android, the status of channel providers for distributing
   handicraft products is increasingly important (Thien et al., 2020).
   This is the biggest enlightenment brought to practitioners by the
   mobile Internet in the outbreak stage.

From 2G to 5G

   With the issuance of 4G LTE license by the Ministry of Industry and
   Information Technology in 2013, domestic cell phone users officially
   ushered in the 4G era (Karabiyik et al., 2020). In 2014, the real-time
   competitive MOBA hand GAME “Vainglory” was launched, emphasizing the
   real-time nature of network online, while “Magic Spirit Summoning,”
   “Tower Legend” and other nurturing RPG GAME, although the gameplay is
   focused on the standalone part, the official will regularly update a
   large amount of GAME content to keep the GAME fresh and the passion of
   gamers, so an efficient network becomes very important (Wang et al.,
   2015).

   4G networks (Figure 2) use LTE technology on the prime 1,800 and 800 M
   spectrum bands, with a theoretical maximum mobile network speed of 100
   Mbps and actual 10 M–30 Mbps. 5G networks use Massive MIMO technology
   in the 3.5 GHz range, which can theoretically reach a wireless data
   rate of 1 Gbps, greatly increasing wireless data bandwidth and enabling
   mobile GAME with less hourly delay and faster rate, giving gamers a
   better and faster gaming experience (Zappone et al., 2016). Mobile
   GAME are a cross-regional, cross-cultural, cross-racial, and
   cross-religious entertainment. It allows gamers to realize the ability
   to be entertained at home, on the subway, and outdoors with gamers
   around the world at any time. These demands reflect the advantages of
   4G LTE and later 4G LTE-A networks, which can provide bandwidth based
   on priority, allowing more traffic to devices with higher download
   demands and transferring data to multiple devices at the same time,
   thus making the mobile network a stronger experience. Whether it’s skin
   updates for MOBAs or massive updates for nurturing GAME, which can be
   downloaded to gamers’ phones faster (Buzzi et al., 2012).
   FIGURE 2
   www.frontiersin.org

   Figure 2. Evolution of mobile generation from 1G to 5G.

   In 2015, “Arena of Alor” was publicly tested together with “We MOBA”
   and other multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) GAME, and most
   handheld gamers were brought into the tide of MOBA GAME (Buzzi et al.,
   2016). These GAME are not only fast to get started, but also have
   compact gameplay and gorgeous graphics effects, which not only require
   excellent performance of network environment where the handheld gamers
   are located, but also challenge the hardware performance of cell phones
   (Zhang et al., 2017). The complex lighting and particle effects in the
   GAME make the CPU and GPU in the SoC take a lot of pressure; at this
   time, the modem in the phone can’t be idle and needs to coordinate the
   network to cope with transferring the various data that occur in the
   GAME. Such comprehensive needs have led more cell phone manufacturers
   to start launching products that emphasize cell phone performance and
   networking capabilities (Chiang et al., 2021).

   This trend has prompted more developers to bring a wider variety of
   GAME with richer titles to the mobile platform. Almost every year,
   several topical titles emerge, such as “Crackdown 3” in 2016, “Monument
   Valley 2” in 2017, and “World in Pictures” and “Florence” in 2018,
   which expose more smartphone users to the “video GAME” entertainment
   genre (Guo et al., 2019). For most gamers, the connected competitive
   GAME like 2018’s Peaceful Elite handheld, Wild Ride 9: Racing Legends
   and the new Call of Duty Mobile in 2019 are their best choices (Guo et
   al., 2019).

   From black and white screen feature phones to large screen touch
   smartphones, not only cell phones have changed over the past 10 years,
   but the way we work, live and play GAME has changed dramatically. As
   5G technology gets closer to us, mobile GAME will take on a more
   diverse look with new technology and new hardware, such as 5G cloud
   GAME will also bring richer GAME products to more gamers, using 5G’s
   high speed and low latency advantages, host and PC GAME will also
   become possible to load in real time on the mobile side (Habiba and
   Hossain, 2018). This will also bring a different GAME experience for
   handheld gamers.

   The 4G era has brought about the rise of handheld gaming, which has now
   became an important part of the global gaming landscape, with countless
   numbers of handheld gamers, and the demand for mobile gaming
   performance continues to increase. The advent of the 5G era will change
   the GAME experience for gamers at this stage, which is limited by
   equipment and network latency (Akbar et al., 2021). Although 5G is
   still in its infancy, it will definitely have a significant impact on
   the global gaming market in the future (Oberst et al., 2017).

   As 5G technology matures, one of its main applications is to provide a
   smooth cloud gaming experience. In addition, the low latency of 5G and
   the convenience of smartphones will make mobile devices a key platform
   for cloud gaming. Due to the advancement in the network, major mobile
   manufacturers are now launching 5G gaming phones to cater to the market
   and provide a better gaming experience to the gamers. Therefore gaming
   phones have also become one of the selling points for cell phone
   manufacturers.

Psychosocial Effect of Mobile GAME on K12 Children Education Performance

Public Awareness—Negative Content of Mobile GAME

   Many elementary school students are addicted to mobile GAME and cannot
   extricate themselves from GAME, some of them even steal their parents’
   money to recharge for playing GAME and play truant. They only think
   about the mobile GAME all day and all night, and think of all the ways
   to play GAME, so they are not interested in studying at all and their
   academic performance is in a mess. It seems obvious that the more time
   you spend playing GAME, the worse your academic performance, and there
   are studies that have found a correlation between time spent on video
   GAME and students’ academic performance (Padilla-Walker et al., 2009).
   But is poor academic performance really the fault of gaming? It is
   important to note that “correlation” does not mean “causation”: for
   example, just because “sleeping in shoes” is associated with “getting
   up in the morning with a headache,” does that mean that “sleeping in
   shoes causes headaches” is causal? In fact, why do you sleep with your
   shoes on? The most likely reason is that one forgets to take off one’s
   shoes before lying down in bed after drinking too much, and this is the
   factor that has a real causal relationship with “getting up in the
   morning with a headache” (Seo et al., 2019).

   A student who is repeatedly frustrated with his grades, expects
   appreciation and has high expectations of himself, has no outlet for
   his pent-up emotions. But in mobile GAME he can not only vent his
   stress but also receive a quick reward (Chafouleas et al., 2021). The
   situation of students who are already not excelling in their academic
   performance will get worse because playing GAME will waste time in
   learning, thus creating a vicious circle (Laws and Millward, 2001),
   i.e., although playing GAME takes away from our studies, playing GAME
   may only be one point in the chain, and the reasons that lead us to
   play GAME are actually more complex.

Why Are GAME Addictive but Learning Is Usually NOT?

   Compared with learning, mobile GAME have distinct advantages that
   GAME tend to have some measure the progress of participants to some
   extent, meaning that their effort is visible and obvious, whereas
   learning does not (Luder et al., 2020). There is progress in learning,
   but it is a slow process and people are not sensitive to small changes
   (Chen, 2017). The simplest example should be hair, i.e., hair grows
   every day, but it is generally unconscious. If you get a haircut once a
   year, and within a year your hair changes from short to long, people
   around you will not think you have changed, but 1 day you get a haircut
   and it becomes as short again as it was a year ago, people will be
   surprised and say what a big change you have made. But take that big
   change and put it over a long period of time and it won’t feel like
   much. It’s the same with studying, but many people fist pump and swear,
   then study for a while, feel they haven’t made much progress, and give
   up. This is the objective basis for the old cliché on Know Your Enemy
   that “hard work doesn’t always lead to progress” (Chen and Gregory,
   2009). The GAME makes this process visible, turning a large amount into
   many tiny amounts, and it is important to feel that you are improving.

Long-Term and Short-Term Goals

   The tasks set in the GAME are mostly achievable goals, not too easy and
   not too hard. There is a lot of data analysis behind this degree of
   accuracy (Wang et al., 2020). Increasing participation in GAME is
   linked to their benefits and results. Not so with learning. The average
   person does not have this analysis; you put a 500-page book in front of
   them and they will not even read it because they think it is so thick
   that they will not be able to finish it in their lifetime (Hsieh,
   2021). However, these are perfectly achievable if they are divided into
   smaller goals after scientific analysis.

Rewards

   The GAME does such a good job of this. It is clear on the GAME that for
   everything you achieve, you will be rewarded accordingly and your
   efforts will be recognized. On the other hand, learning, has a great
   deal of uncertainty. Working very hard and not getting good results
   happens to almost everyone (Bavelier et al., 2011). This puts a lot of
   people off, so they choose not to try to work hard, so if they succeed
   they will be complacent and think they are clever, and if they fail it
   won’t matter, after all they haven’t put much effort into it.

Uncertainty

   A known reward will motivate people, but unknown factors will really
   keep them going. A reward with appropriate uncertainty will be
   exciting, it will increase people’s dopamine production and fascinate
   people (Gentile et al., 2004). We encounter same situation when we read
   a novel. But when listening to a lesson, this is simply not possible.
   If we could figure out how humans learn and what motivates people to
   act from the development of GAME, then apply it beyond GAME, the
   value it could create is immeasurable, and it would be a
   ground-breaking thing.

The Psychosocial Impact of Mobile GAME

   In fact, the psychosocial mechanisms behind playing GAME deserve more
   attention than academic performance. Often the decline in academic
   performance is the most easily observed, but the relationship between
   playing video GAME and soft aspects such as feelings of loneliness,
   loss, self-esteem, social anxiety and social skills is often
   overlooked. These commonly overlooked factors largely contribute to
   negative events that influence our perceptions of mobile GAME (Han et
   al., 2009).

   According to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs theory (Figure 3), human needs
   are divided into five categories from low to high: physiological needs,
   security needs, social needs, respect needs, and self-actualization
   needs. When the lower level needs are satisfied, the next level needs
   will become the primary motivation (Boyer, 2015; Li et al., 2021). So
   when we have satisfied the two basic needs of physiological needs and
   security needs, the pursuit of spirituality will rise to become the
   main conflict. So people who are not able to socialize properly have no
   way of satisfying their social needs and other higher needs, so for
   such people there is a greater need for a space to socialize and
   achieve things that are not possible in real life. (Kowert et al.,
   2015) have found that people who have low self-esteem in real life, are
   lonely, lack social skills, and are less successful in real life tend
   to spend more time in video GAME (Winter et al., 2016). In turn,
   playing video GAME further exacerbates gamers’ feelings of loneliness
   and increased dissatisfaction with life (Kowert et al., 2015).
   FIGURE 3
   www.frontiersin.org

   Figure 3. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs theory.

   A successful mobile GAME is inevitably appealing because of the high
   sense of achievement that teenagers can feel in the GAME again. Imagine
   that people who are not respected in real life can be admired for their
   virtual achievements in the GAME, either through kryptonite (spending
   money to increase combat power) or through their skill in playing the
   GAME. Even if you don’t make it to the top of the leader boards, you
   can still find a presence in a variety of ways. Moreover, in online
   GAME, without the constraints of real identities and conditions,
   gamers can communicate more flexibly and with less embarrassment of
   being rejected due to real conditions, communication between people is
   easier and gamers can easily build closer relationships through various
   tasks (Caplan et al., 2009).

   These people who are dissatisfied with their real lives can find a
   sense of presence in the GAME in a variety of ways to escape their
   real-life dissatisfaction (Figure 4). However, after being satisfied in
   the virtual world, when they return to their real life, the gap will be
   even greater, and this will deepen their dissatisfaction with their
   real life. In addition, it is important to note that excessive play can
   also cause distraction, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
   and psychological disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder and
   anxiety in children (Chan and Cheng, 2004; Bulduklu, 2017).
   FIGURE 4
   www.frontiersin.org

   Figure 4. Addiction progress of mobile GAME and its different stages.

Anti-social Behavior Caused by Mobile GAME

   The content of many mobile GAME is full of fighting and killing,
   gunfire, wild and weird characters, mechanical and rough movements,
   absurd plot and fast rhythm, which have a serious negative impact on
   students’ moral and psychological health. Those students who are
   addicted to GAME are often not calm enough, restless, impulsive,
   indifferent to others, and more violent, bringing certain destabilizing
   factors to the campus, family and society. They are in reality, but
   their minds are in the online world, and they are prone to
   schizophrenia symptoms, and few children who are addicted to mobile
   GAME are psychologically healthy. Nowadays, anti-social behavior also
   brings much attention to mobile GAME study. Although video GAME have
   been designed and developed to entertain (or educate), it has to be
   admitted that many of them contain violent content. According to data
   from Children Now 2001, a non-profit organization concerned with
   children’s learning and development, as early as 15 years ago, 89% of
   all GAME contained violent content, and nearly half of them contained
   severe violence (Bulduklu, 2017).

   Researchers have found that excessive immersion in GAME with
   antisocial content (violence) can easily lead to addiction and that
   such GAME have a subtle effect on gamers: they lack empathy and are
   prone to destructive behavior in real life. In fact, for gamers, the
   violent stimuli provided by virtual worlds such as combat are not only
   a stress relief, but also a training exercise that allows them to
   become accustomed to such aggressive emotions and destructive behavior
   in GAME, which they gradually carry over into real life (Huizenga et
   al., 2009).

   In a study conducted in 2011, Anderson and Bushman surveyed over 4,000
   gamers and found that violent GAME increased aggressive emotions and
   decreased pro-social behaviour. Both children and adults, men and women
   were deeply affected by this (Foerster et al., 2019). This is not to
   say that violent play necessarily leads to violent behavior. However,
   when we are constantly trained to think about our enemies in GAME and
   reinforced to react quickly and aggressively to each other’s actions,
   we constantly rehearse this script in our minds and feel threatened all
   the time, which translates into real-life situations where we are also
   hostile to those around us and develop “hostile attribution bias”
   (Venetz et al., 2014). For example, if Ming knocks over my cup, I will
   think that Ming thinks I am a bad person, that he is doing it on
   purpose, and that I have to beat him up to show him so that he would
   not do it again. But in reality, the aisle was too narrow and Ming was
   too fat and accidentally knocked it over. This attribution error is the
   “hostile attribution bias.”

   It must be clear here that it is not the video GAME that causes the
   gamer’s antisocial behavior, but the violent content of the video GAME.
   It is pointless and even counterproductive to make a blanket statement.
   We should advocate for the regulation of the video GAME market and the
   development of sensible GAME content, rather than a blanket ban on all
   video GAME.

Further Actions May Take for Correct Guidance

The Core Educational Value of Mobile GAME

   Most scholars are studying how to make learning more interesting, so
   that students can learn by doing as what the mobile GAME does. This is
   the dream of our educational researchers, and Dewey’s emphasis on
   “learning by doing” does not seem to be working particularly well. In
   contrast, in a virtual environment we can learn by doing, which is
   similar to the real thing, improving students’ problem-solving skills,
   creativity and other higher-order skills, and helping to develop
   emotional and attitudinal values (Villasana et al., 2020). This is why
   educational scholars are proposing to implement gamified learning,
   using educational GAME to achieve gamified learning. Gamified learning
   in a narrow sense generally refers to pure video GAME, while gamified
   learning in a broad sense includes GAME mechanics, GAME element design
   concepts, etc.

   The core educational values of GAME are mainly acting on the aspects
   of psychology, socialization, and culture. With its effect on play
   motivation, playful thinking, and playfulness (Figure 5), a good mobile
   GAME does need multiple aspects of knowledge, ability, emotions,
   attitudes and values (Schwab, 2018). Play motivation is the most
   fundamental and operational value, emphasizing the use of play to
   motivate learning. Playful thinking suggests going beyond playful forms
   and emphasizes the design of non-playful learning activities as
   “GAME.” Playfulness is the most meaningful value emphasizing that
   learners approach the process and outcomes of learning with the same
   spirit and attitude as play. The core link between the three aspects is
   deep intrinsic motivation (Škařupová et al., 2016). Getting people to
   do something because they are challenged and to be curious, rather than
   being pushed to do something every day by external rewards and
   pressures.
   FIGURE 5
   www.frontiersin.org

   Figure 5. Core educational value of mobile GAME.

Gamification of Education/Educational Mobile GAME

   In the design of educational gamification, it is important to focus on
   an important issues: distinguishing the age group of the user.
   Gamification of education is more suitable for the K12 age group and
   should generally be in the form of simple GAME, with the degree of
   gamification decreasing with the age of the user increasing; there will
   be some adults over 18 who prefer educational products in the form of
   large-scale GAME such as online GAME, but this may be a niche market
   (Abeele et al., 2017). A light GAME should be a balance between
   learning and gameplay, it is like a layer of ketchup in the middle of a
   hamburger, it can be a little less, but too much is definitely not. If
   the GAME is too complex, it will take away from the main focus, the
   child will appear to be learning but spend more time playing, and the
   level of emotional arousal will be too high, which is not the desired
   learning effect. Don’t design a product to be “revolutionary” right out
   of the box, ground it and then change it incrementally, although this
   is the opposite of what Google’s Page says (Huijsmans, 2019).

   This is because schooling is absolutely dominant in the educational
   lives of primary and secondary school children, and most of the people
   who deliver schooling—the teachers—have extremely difficult to change
   work habits and lack the motivation to change. There are many reasons
   for this, which will not be expanded. Therefore the initial product
   should ideally be close to the actual working habits of teachers, close
   to the teaching content of the school, find a real solution to certain
   high frequency needs of teachers in their daily work and cut in, so
   that they can first get started, develop trust and dependence, and then
   expand step by step, it will be more feasible. Educational products are
   not super viable just because they are gamified, and you can’t expect
   them to get a lot of users and get the desired conversion rate just
   because they are “happy learning” (Schneider et al., 2020). It is
   always believed that educational products for primary and secondary
   schools should be a combination of online and offline. In addition to
   the online part of the product, it also needs to include an offline
   package for teachers and parents, including training, guidance,
   evaluation, consultation and follow-up, and so on. For example, how
   teachers use the product in the classroom, how they use it after
   school, or what they do to provide daily feedback to parents, are all
   parts of the product and need to be developed into an actionable
   solution, not optional. Otherwise, even the best design will be
   short-lived and will end up like a normal GAME after its life cycle.
   So, as well as the product team, the operations team is equally
   important (Cha and Seo, 2018). While designing the gamification, don’t
   forget to build and polish the educational content itself, which is the
   main part of the “hamburger.” Entrepreneurs are often in a hurry to get
   their products to market quickly and can easily over-gamify them. But
   the lifeblood of an educational product is still the quality of
   education, and when the learning effect is not reflected, it will face
   the dilemma of further development.

Future Trends and Limitations in Educational Mobile GAME

   Future trends, from a technological perspective, combine gamified
   learning with mobile learning; with VR/AR; with intelligent bodies;
   with brain science; with artificial intelligence and big data (Quelly
   et al., 2016; Black et al., 2018). If the research is to solve
   students’ learning problems through mobile GAME, it is necessary to
   combine various research results and educational results from GAME
   design. Experimental research in this area has been conducted and found
   it to be quite effective. Through this experiment, it is found that the
   difficulty in developing this type of GAME is decided by how it can
   really enhance their learning effectiveness (Calpbinici and Tas Arslan,
   2019).

   Still, GAME are GAME, and still there are four major limitation for
   the current development of educational mobile GAME.:

   • The first major limitation is portability, that is, how what is
   learned in a mobile GAME transfers to the real world, which exposes the
   Achilles heel of mobile GAME. The challenges in video GAME are often
   fictional and have no connection to everyday life, but are rather a
   fantasy. The knowledge and skills that K12 students acquire in GAME
   such as battling dragons, racing jousts, and Tetris are not meaningful
   to everyday life and therefore not directly transferable.

   • The second major limitation is simplicity. Mobile GAME simplify
   complex systems to their core and are procedural representations of the
   real world. The world we live in is much more complex and often defies
   the simple logic of the GAME. This results in learners often losing
   touch with the systems modeled in the GAME.

   • The third major limitation is that GAME lack real-life environments.
   Mobile GAME are not designed to have an effect on the gamer after the
   GAME is over. The K12 students are too different from the world they
   live in, and the real world is too complex. Even those GAME that have
   a realistic purpose, so-called serious GAME or educational GAME,
   mostly fail in their transfer from the GAME to the real world. This is
   good news for those who fear that violent GAME make people violent,
   and bad news for those who think that smart GAME automatically make
   people smart.

   • The fourth major limitation relates to the above question about the
   environment. K12 students are usually unable to spontaneously establish
   a relationship between what they learn in mobile GAME and real life.
   They can grasp a great deal of information in mobile GAME and remember
   it over time, but are unable to recall the simplest historical data in
   the classroom. The link between learning achievements in GAME and in
   the real world is often overlooked by many K12 students and teachers.

   GAME open the door to the transfer of learning experiences, but K12
   students must go through this door themselves. For that matter, the
   role of teaching behavior in the use of mobile GAME is clearly
   underestimated. Learners need constructive support to draw outcomes
   relevant to their own learning from a rewarding play space. There may
   not be a fundamental difference in the traditional sense of learning,
   but there is a difference in the logical growth and understanding of
   GAME (Rahim et al., 2020). Besides, the illusory nature of the mobile
   gaming experience makes the transfer of results very difficult. In
   response, external forces are needed to drive attention toward the
   potential and the knowledge learned. Teachers can and should use this
   meta-perspective to promote the pedagogical potential of play. The
   content of the learning outcomes, the enhancement of skills and
   knowledge, should be explored together with the K12 students. A bridge
   between the virtual and real worlds is built when all these gamers take
   note of the content and learning outcomes in question. The questions
   that need to be answered on the teaching side are which real-world
   environments can apply what is learned in the GAME and which aspects of
   the GAME are worth learning from. And gamers, the K12 students, should
   be motivated to notice this connection and to test what they have
   learned in their everyday lives (Kyriakou and Glentis, 2021).

Conclusion

   This paper summarizes the technological development of mobile GAME
   from the aspects of hardware and software. A neutral perspective is
   given to analyze the psychological and social problems that mobile
   GAME have brought to K12 students. At the end of the paper, the
   insights of the future development of educational GAME and current
   limitations of mobile GAME are also addressed. The major task for the
   development is to reflect on the content of the mobile GAME, which is
   not directly accessible. It is difficult to examine what is learned
   with a critical eye during play and must therefore be stimulated
   externally. The act of teaching and learning enables knowledge and
   skills transfer if the teacher has the ability to build bridges between
   the virtual and real worlds. Radically speaking, it is only through
   pedagogical support that the barriers to knowledge transfer in gamified
   learning can be overcome and the potential for learning unlocked. This
   new pedagogical role requires the teacher’s own interest, as well as
   active access to the space of gamified learning. This area deserves to
   be explored and experimented with and will present teachers with new
   pedagogical challenges.

   In the letter to shareholders heard ‘round the entertainment world,
   Netflix famously admitted that it competes with — and loses to — the
   popular video GAME Fortnite more than HBO. And while the gargantuan
   success of that Epic GAME blockbuster surely remains an outlier, the
   subtext is unmistakable: In the knock-down, drag-out competition for
   users’ screen time, the video gaming industry is booming where
   yesterday’s entertainment forerunners are lagging, if not outright
   busting.

   The global video GAME market is projected to see more than $365 billion
   in revenue for 2023, which is up from almost $320 billion in 2022,
   according to data from Statista. The gaming industry owes some of that
   success to its adaptation of tech breakthroughs and its discovery of
   new business strategies — both of which are also generated internally.

   the Year awards; and the internally produced documentary Raising
   Kratos, about the tolls of GAME development.

   Devolver Digital seeks out and shines a light on GAME from all over
   the planet, usually ones with a firmly offbeat sensibility. Examples
   range from a Swedish-made “violent ballet about friendship,
   imagination, and one man’s struggle to obliterate anyone in his path at
   the behest of a sentient banana,” to a turn-based adventure from a
   scrappy Polish indie about growing and selling weed.

   Advertising in video GAME is the integration of advertising into video
   GAME to promote products, organizations, or viewpoints.^[1]

   There are two major categories of advertising in video GAME: in-GAME
   advertising and adverGAME.^[2] In-GAME advertising shows the player
   advertisements while playing the GAME,^[3] whereas adverGAME are a
   type of GAME created to serve as an advertisement for a brand or
   product.^[4]

   Other methods of advertising in video GAME include in-GAME product
   placement and sponsorship of commercial GAME or other GAME-related
   content.^[5]

Categories[edit]

In-GAME advertising[edit]

   Main article: In-GAME advertising
   [220px-FIFA_International_Soccer.gif] An Adidas billboard is displayed
   in the foreground of the 1994 video GAME FIFA International Soccer
   (also, the electronic board that appears with every goal scored
   sometimes reads "Panasonic").

   In-GAME advertising is similar to product placement in films and
   television, where the advertising content exists within the universe of
   the characters. These forms of product placement are common, which led
   to the advertisement technique being applied to video GAME to match
   evolving media consumption habits.^[6]^[7] According to the
   Entertainment Software Association in 2010, 42% of gamers said they
   play online GAME one or more hours per week.^[8] GAME playing is
   considered active media consumption, which provides a unique
   opportunity for advertisers. The principal advantages of product
   placement in gaming are visibility and notoriety. A single in-GAME
   advertisement may be encountered by the player multiple times, and
   advertisers have an opportunity to ally a brand's image with that of a
   well-received GAME.

   Billboards, storefronts, posters, apparel, vehicles, weapons, fliers,
   sponsored product placement, and the interplay between the player and
   these elements in the GAME allow for a great degree of virtual
   advertisement.^[9] Examples of marketing in video GAME include brand
   integration, embedded marketing, recruitment tools, edutainment, and
   traditional in-GAME advertising.

   According to Forbes, in-GAME advertising is expected to reach $7.2
   billion in 2016.^[10] Unlike television commercials and digital ads,
   which can be avoided by using DVRs and ad-blocking software,
   advertisements embedded within video GAME cannot be bypassed. A more
   recent example of in-GAME advertising is Google's placement of video
   ads between levels of GAME. These ads are usually branded inline, and
   TechCrunch reports that they have the potential to gain fast traction
   in Google's AdMob Service.^[11]

Static in-GAME advertising[edit]

   Static in-GAME advertisements are embedded into the video GAME
   program.^[9] Static ads can be used in the story-line of the GAME and
   players can interact with them.^[9] The creation of the ads can take
   from a month or years to reach the public.^[9] These ads do not require
   players to have access to an Internet connection in order to display
   the campaigns.^[9] Limitations include ads becoming outdated or
   irrelevant as consumer habits change.^[9] Because these ads cannot
   change once released to the public, they also lack the ability to be
   customized based on player demographics.^[9] Examples include
   billboards advertising for (and product placement of) Bawls energy
   drink in Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, and billboards for Adidas
   sportswear in FIFA International Soccer.

Dynamic in-GAME advertising[edit]

   Dynamic in-GAME advertisements are embedded in online video GAME that
   can be changed at any time by the GAME programmers.^[9]^[6] Examples of
   this type of advertisement would be virtual billboards and updates that
   introduce new items into the GAME like clothing brands to dress
   characters or different cars.^[6] Dynamics ads are different from
   static GAME because companies can provide ads for specific audiences
   or demographics after the video GAME has been purchased by the
   consumer.^[6] This way companies can follow the consumer habits and
   provide ads that can address a certain context.^[6] GAME developers
   then can dynamically change the virtual ads spaces embedded into the
   GAME to display the ads.^[7] Players have a limited interaction with
   these ads compared to static in-GAME ads.^[9] These ads required active
   Internet connection for the GAME company to showcase the ads.^[9]
   Dynamic ads can accommodate time sensitive campaigns and can be shown
   immediately.^[9] These ads can also provide data to show how well
   campaigns are doing unlike static in-GAME ads.^[9]

AdverGAME[edit]

   Main article: AdverGAME

   Video GAME that are expressly commissioned to promote a product or
   service are referred to as "adverGAME", a portmanteau of "advertising"
   and "gaming". This term was coined in January 2000 by Anthony
   Giallourakis and later mentioned by Wired's "Jargon Watch" column in
   2001.^[12] AdverGAME have been developed for different platforms
   including company websites, gaming consoles, and more recently, mobile
   applications and social media platforms.^[13] With the growth of the
   Internet, adverGAME have proliferated, often becoming the most visited
   aspect of brand websites and becoming an integrated part of brand media
   planning. The adverGAME sector reached $207 million in 2007.^[14]

   The earliest custom video GAME featuring integrated brand messages
   were developed and distributed on floppy disk.^[15] These GAME were
   distributed for free, often bundled with other products from the
   company advertised for. The first floppy disk adverGAME were developed
   to serve dual purposes—as promotional incentives that drive response
   and as media that deliver awareness. American Home Foods Chef Boyardee
   issued one of the earliest floppy-disk adverGAME.^[16] Some brands,
   like Kool-Aid and Pepsi, created early adverGAME on gaming platforms.
   They created adverGAME for the Atari 2600 and gave out promotional
   copies.^[15] The first in-box CD-ROM cereal box adverGAME are General
   Mills's Chex Quest (promoting the Chex brand) and General Mills's
   All-Star baseball (starring Trix Rabbit and his friends playing
   baseball against Major League teams and stars).

   Commercial examples include adverGAME funded by Pepsi, 7 Up, NFL,
   Formula One, and Burger King. Political and military examples of
   below-the-line (BTL) adverGAME include recruitment tools like
   America's Army, intended to boost recruitment for the United States
   Army, and Special Force, intended to promote Muslim resistance to the
   state of Israel. Educational advergaming is closely related to the
   Serious GAME initiative and falls under either Edumarket gaming or
   edutainment. Examples include Food Force (made by the United Nations's
   World Food Program) and Urban Jungle, an educational traffic
   simulation.

Through-the-line advertising[edit]

   [220px-ILoveBees_-_Homepage.png] I Love Bees makes use of
   "link-chasing" and is designed to foster viral marketing.

   Examples of through-the-line (TTL) advertising in GAME include
   "link-chases," ARGs, and viral marketing.

   TTL marketing is a form of advertising in video GAME that involve the
   use of URL hyperlinks within the GAME designed to induce the player to
   visit a web page which then contains BTL advertisements. The technique
   used to tempt the player into visiting the intended URL varies from
   GAME to GAME.^[17] In GAME like Pikmin 2, the player is given a
   cryptic message with an accompanying URL designed to pique their
   curiosity. In GAME such as Enter the Matrix, Year Zero, I Love Bees,
   and Lost Experience, URLs make up a part of the background of the GAME
   such that certain plot details can only be learned by following the
   link. The knowledge of such plot details are typically not required to
   complete the GAME, but deepen the GAME story-line for players who
   follow the links. Websites of this nature often lead players on to
   other links which again lead to further links, thus earning these GAME
   the label "link-chases". Although TTL advertising can be an enjoyable
   experience for players, excessive "link-chasing" can feel obstructive
   and discourage them from diving deeper into a GAME's story-line. In
   another form, the URL might be part of a stage where a player can see
   it but it does not affect the plot. For example, in Super Monkey Ball
   2, there is a stage where players can see clearly written on an
   obstacle a URL and the stage's name is even the word URL.

Industry impact[edit]

Prevalence and efficacy[edit]

   In 2019, a survey conducted by deltaDNA found that 94% of free-to-play
   video GAME developers incorporate some form of in-GAME
   advertising.^[18] Among those, the most common type of advertisement
   were rewarded videos, which are videos that players can watch to earn
   in-GAME prizes.^[18] Rewarded videos are shown to be more effective
   than forced advertising; players are 23% more likely to buy products
   and 18% more likely to make in-app purchases when shown rewarded videos
   instead of forced advertising.^[19]

   The reaction to in-GAME advertising has been overall positive, with 73%
   of players being happy with ad-funded GAME.^[19]

   The effectiveness of advertising in video GAME is debated by
   scholars.^[3]^[20]^[21] Brand name recognition in sports GAME has been
   shown to be low among college students, although players did retain
   fragments of the brand names.^[3] Another study found that 35% of
   players could recall advertised brands in car racing GAME.^[20]
   Interactive in-GAME advertisements, such as brand products that are
   used in GAME, are shown to produce greater brand awareness and more
   positive brand attitudes than passively added advertisements, such as
   posters or billboards.^[21]

Mobile[edit]

   Mobile in-GAME advertisements are advertisements within mobile GAME
   that lead the user to the website or installation page of the
   advertised product or software upon being clicked.^[22] Mobile gaming
   advertisements can take different forms, including banner ads, pop-up
   ads, video ads, and interactive ads. Banner ads will display on
   portions of the screen while the user continues to interact with the
   mobile GAME.^[23] Pop-up ads will display the advertisement on the
   entire mobile screen, typically disrupting gameplay; they appear
   between loading screens or when in-GAME milestones are completed, only
   allowing users to close the pop-up ad once a timer runs out.^[24] Video
   ads will display a video advertisement of the advertised products on
   the entire mobile screen.^[25] Interactive ads are a form of pop-up ad
   that allows the user to interact with the advertisement.^[26] For
   instance, Candy Crush Saga, a free-to-play mobile GAME, uses playable
   ads to advertise their GAME on other mobile applications and provide
   potential customers with a demo of their GAME.^[27] In 2019, mobile
   advertising contributed $39.9 billion in revenue to the mobile gaming
   industry.^[28]

ESRB[edit]

   The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) assigns ratings based on
   a detailed questionnaire about the GAME's content and a gameplay clip
   provided by the publisher.^[29] Possible rating categories are
   "Everyone", "Everyone 10+", "Teen", "Mature 17+", and "Adults Only
   18+".^[30] Ratings are supplemented with content descriptions, such as
   "Blood", "Partial Nudity", and "Use of Alcohol".^[30] All updates and
   downloadable content (DLC), including both static and dynamic in-GAME
   advertising, are expected to be compliant with the GAME's rating and
   descriptors, though DLC can be submitted for its own, independent
   rating if necessary.^[31]

   If any post-release content is determined to be incompatible with the
   rating of the base GAME, publishers are required to update all physical
   and digital displays of the rating.^[29] In the case of physical GAME,
   where it is difficult to make these modifications once a GAME has
   shipped, sanctions and fines may be levied on the publisher.^[29]

   The ESRB also includes an Advertising Review Council (ARC) that
   oversees the marketing of video GAME in the United States and
   Canada.^[32] Cross-promotion, including when a video GAME is promoted
   within another, falls under this umbrella.^[32] The ARC ensures that
   the GAME being advertised is accurately represented and is not being
   marketed toward parties below the suitable age range.^[32]

Legislative developments[edit]

Academic research[edit]

   The University of Bath's Institute for Policy Research researched the
   use of adverGAME in marketing to children in the United Kingdom.^[33]
   The report, published in June 2014, suggested that children as old as
   15 did not recognize that adverGAME were adverts and had their food
   choices influenced without their conscious awareness.^[34] Based on
   these findings, the University called for "urgent government action to
   protect children from the subconscious effects of adverGAME."^[33]

United States legislation[edit]

Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998[edit]

   The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) directs
   the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to protect the personal data
   collected from children online.^[35] Operators of websites or online
   services are barred from handling the personal information of children
   under the age of 13 without verifiable consent from a parent or
   guardian.^[36] Restrictions apply to any website or online service that
   is targeted toward children or has knowledge that it is collecting data
   from children.^[36]

Do Not Track Kids Acts[edit]

   Representatives Edward Markey [D-MA] and Joe Barton [R-TX] proposed the
   Do Not Track Kids Act of 2011 as an amendment to COPPA.^[37] The bill
   would have extended COPPA to prohibit companies from distributing
   personal and geolocation information knowingly collected from minors
   for use in targeted advertising.^[37] It also expands the restrictions
   enumerated in the act to both online and mobile applications, which had
   previously been omitted.^[37]

   Regarding his motivation for co-sponsoring the Act, Representative
   Barton reflected, "We have reached a troubling point in the state of
   the business when companies that conduct business online are so eager
   to make a buck, they resort to targeting our children."^[38]

   Since the death of the 2011 bill, Markey and Barton have continued to
   spawn similar Do Not Track Kids legislation in both chambers of
   Congress.^[39]^[40]^[41]^[42]^[43]^[44] These bills were proposed in
   2013, 2015, and 2018, though none of them passed through the committee
   stage.^[39]^[40]^[41]^[42]^[43]^[44]

Targeted adverGAME marketing[edit]

   A bill was recently introduced in the Senate that proposes restrictions
   on the use of information obtained through adverGAME to market to
   children. Some GAME ask users to provide personal information, such as
   name, gender, and age, then display targeted advertisements based on
   these characteristics. This bill would prevent companies from using
   this information to change the GAME to target certain age brackets.

Examples[edit]

Food and beverages[edit]

     * Mattel's M Network division released the "promoGAME" Kool-Aid Man
       for the Atari 2600 and Intellivision in 1983. The GAME was
       originally available only via mail order by sending in UPC symbols
       from Kool-Aid containers, but later became available for retail
       purchase.^[45]^[46]
     * Purina had a mail-in offer for the Atari 2600 GAME Chase the Chuck
       Wagon for customers of Chuck Wagon dog food in 1983.^[46]
     * Johnson &amp Johnson released an Atari 2600 GAME called Tooth
       Protectors in 1983, also by mail-order.^[46]
     * In 1999, Pepsiman was released by developer KID in only Japan for
       the PlayStation. It focuses the player on avoiding obstacles to
       save dehydrated people by bringing them a can of Pepsi.
     * In November 2006, Burger King began selling three advergaming Xbox
       and Xbox 360 titles for an additional $3.99 ($4.99 in Canada) each
       with any value meal. Known as the King GAME series, these GAME
       include Sneak King (Xbox, 2006), PocketBike Racer (Xbox, 2006), and
       Big Bumpin' (Xbox 360, 2006). They were all developed by Blitz
       GAME' Blitz Arcade Division and were the best selling GAME of the
       2006 holiday season.^[47] More than 3.2 million copies are believed
       to have been sold in the US and Canada alone.
     * Life Savers launched the web's first major advergaming portal,
       Candystand,^[48] in March 1997. The website was acquired from the
       Wrigley Company by Funtank in August 2008 and hosts adverGAME for
       a broad range of brands.
     * Doritos sponsored the adverGAME Doritos Crash Course, which was
       released on the Xbox 360 in December 2010.^[49] The GAME included
       fifteen 2.5D obstacle courses for the player's Xbox Avatar to
       navigate.^[49] The GAME's sequel, Doritos Crash Course 2, was
       released on Xbox Live Arcade in May 2013.^[50]
     * In 2011, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Subway launched an ad
       campaign that allowed players to access the multiplayer mode of
       Uncharted 3 a month prior to its release date.^[51] Players could
       earn in-GAME items such as a Subway uniform or sandwich.^[51] The
       main character of the Uncharted series also explicitly references
       the Subway five dollar footlong.^[51]
     * In 2019, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Monster Energy launched
       an ad campaign in the PlayStation 4 title Death Stranding, in which
       the protagonist is able to consume the energy drink for a boost to
       their stamina meter.^[52]

Movies and entertainment[edit]

     * Cineplex Entertainment features an adverGAME open to the public,
       known as Top Popper during non-contest periods and Peel and Pop
       during contest periods. In the cinemas, there is a TimePlay
       adverGAME that plays before the show.^[citation needed]
     * Fortnite and Marvel Entertainment teamed up in 2018 to promote
       Avengers: Infinity War by bringing Thanos, the film's antagonist,
       into the battle royale GAME.^[53] A limited-time GAME mode allowed
       one player at a time to become Thanos, giving them several new
