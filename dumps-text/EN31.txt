   young hunter kneeling next to giant black ox No, a dangerous game rifle
   does not have to cost as much as a used pickup truck. But, it does have
   to pack a punch and be every time, all the time, reliable. Richard Mann

   Regardless of what you've read, and what you might hear experts advise,
   the number one requirement of a dangerous game rifle is reliability. It
   can be exquisitely beautiful with engravings of naked concubines and
   vicious creatures, but if it does not work every time and all the time,
   it is not a dangerous game rifle.

   Many believe a rifle of this sort has to be expensive but that's not
   the case. It only must work and deliver a hard enough hit to get the
   job done. Knowing those facts, if you can afford to hunt dangerous
   game, you can probably afford a reliable and (very) nice hard-hitting
   rifle. To help find one that's right for you, here is a list of 20 of
   the finest dangerous game guns available, working from a beer to a
   champagne budget.
   Mossberg Patriot Laminate Marinecote rifle

   Mossberg Patriot Laminate Marinecote
   Mossberg Patriot Laminate Marinecote o Price: $629

   When most folks think of dangerous game rifles, they think of broken
   wallets and maxed-out credit cards. It doesn't have to be that way.
   Mossberg's Patriot Laminate is a rugged and reliable bolt-action rifle.
   It comes with open sights, a fantastically functional detachable
   magazine, and a great trigger. It's also chambered for the .375 Ruger,
   which is all the gun you need for dangerous game, whether it be lions,
   tigers or bears.

   /shop/en/browning-x-bolt-stainless-stalker-bolt-action-rifle-with-open-
   sights

   Browning

   SEE IT

   Drilled and tapped for scope mounting, but also fitted with adjustable
   open sights, and chambered for the most classic of all dangerous-game
   cartridges--the .375 H&H--this rifle is ready for rough country and
   perilous encounters. The stainless steel action and barrel are fitted
   to an ergonomic synthetic stock with checkered grip panels. It has a
   3-round magazine capacity and weighs only 6 pounds, 13 ounces, so those
   long treks on the track of buffalo won't wear you out.
   CZ 550 American Safari Magnum rifle

   CZ 550 American Safari Magnum
   CZ 550 American Safari Magnum o Price: $1,215

   Built on CZ-USA's famous 550 Magnum action, this rifle is intended for
   use with magnified optics, but back-up iron sights are there if needed.
   The stock has a high, flat comb to better aid eye alignment with both
   optics and irons, and the round forend won't snag on brush while
   stalking. Many professional hunters prefer the 550's Mauser-style
   extractor and fixed ejector, and the rifle is available for most of the
   hard-hitting big bore cartridges synonymous with dangerous game
   hunting.
   Ruger Hawkeye African rifle

   Ruger Hawkeye African
   Ruger Hawkeye African o Price: $1,279

   Loaded with features like a non-rotating Mauser-style extractor, fixed
   ejector, three-position safety, hinged floor plate, integral scope
   mounts, express style open sights, and the Ruger LC6 trigger, this
   rifle offers a lot for your money. And, to help control the big bang
   that comes from cartridges like the .375 and .416 Ruger, the muzzle is
   capped off with the removable Ruger Muzzle Brake System. This rifle
   looks as attractive as it's price tag.
   Winchester Model 70 Safari Express rifle

   Winchester

   SEE IT

   Available in .375 H&H, .416 Remington Magnum, and .458 Winchester
   Magnum, the Model 70 Safari Express is a fine representation of what
   many expect in a dangerous game rifle. The satin finished stock has cut
   checkering, the steel bottom metal is one-piece, and the pre-64
   Winchester action is one that is revered by African professional
   hunters. Modernizations include the M.O.A. Trigger System, with zero
   take-up, zero creep, and zero over travel for outstanding accuracy.
   Ruger No. 1 475 Linebaugh/480 Ruger

   Ruger No. 1 475 Linebaugh/480 Ruger
   Ruger No. 1 475 Linebaugh/480 Ruger (Lipsey's) o Price: $1,919

   Though this may not be the traditional action and cartridge associated
   with dangerous game hunting, the Ruger No. 1 offers a level of
   reliability and strength that is unmatched. And, the .475 Linebaugh
   cartridge will push a 370-grain bullet to almost 1,600 fps. The
   combination isn't great for long range shots, but will knock down
   anything inside spitting distance.
   Marlin Custom Shop 1895 Modern Lever Hunter

   Marlin Custom Shop 1895 Modern Lever Hunter
   Marlin Custom Shop 1895 Modern Lever Hunter o Price: $1,995

   With three times the ammo capacity of a double rifle and faster
   follow-up shots than a bolt action, it could be argued that this fine
   quality .45-70 from the Marlin Custom Shop is ideal for dangerous game.
   Custom crafted to your color preferences, the action of this Marlin
   Model 1895 is smoothed to perfection, and all metal surfaces are coated
   with Cerakote. The XS Sights Lever Rail lets you choose between an
   aperture sight, a red dot, or a conventional or scout style scope.
   CZ Safari Classics Magnum Express Rifle

   CZ Safari Classics Magnum Express Rifle
   CZ Safari Classics Magnum Express Rifle o Price: $2,271

   Available in .375 H&H, .404 Jeffery, .416 Remington, .416 Rigby, .450
   Rigby, .458 Winchester Magnum, .458 Lott, and a variety of other
   dinosaur killing cartridges, this rifle is built to your exact
   specifications. It features a single set trigger, matte or gloss blue
   finish, and a #1 Fancy American Walnut stock, with dual cross bolts and
   a straight comb. A muzzle brake, ebony forend, and a weather resistant
   coating are options, while the Mauser-style extractor and hammer-forged
   barrel are standard.
   Remington Model 700 Custom C Grade

   Remington Model 700 Custom C Grade
   Remington Model 700 Custom C Grade o Price: $2,995

   Don't let anyone tell you the push-feed Model 700 action is not up to
   the task when it comes to dangerous game hunting. Not only is it
   reliable, but you can drop a cartridge in the ejection port and close
   the bolt for a follow-up shot if you run the rifle dry--something most
   controlled-round-feed actions cannot do. A gloss finished, C-grade
   walnut stock, with contrasting grip and forend tips makes this a
   luxurious safari rifle.
   Weatherby Mark V Dangerous Game Rifle

   Weatherby Mark V Dangerous Game Rifle
   Weatherby Mark V Dangerous Game Rifle o Price: $3,600

   Weatherby is a brand synonymous with the African continent and
   high-dollar hunts. Their Dangerous Game Rifle offers a sub-MOA accuracy
   guarantee, the Weatherby LXX trigger, a short 54-degree bolt lift, and
   the famous Weatherby Magnum 9-lug action. The action is bedded in a
   hand-laminated, composite stock, with a raised Monte Carlo comb, and is
   finished with spider web accents. It's available in six Weatherby
   chamberings and .375 H&H.
   Dakota Arms Model 76 Safari

   Dakota Arms Model 76 Safari
   Dakota Arms Model 76 Safari o Price: $8,900

   Gorgeous and deadly might be the best way to describe this bolt-action
   rifle built for African safaris and dangerous game hunting. Constructed
   on the famous Dakota Model 76 action, it's available for right or left
   hand shooters, with a XXX walnut stock, hand-cut checkering, ebony
   forend tip and barrel band in a variety of chamberings up to .458 Lott.
   Dakota Arms Professional Hunter rifle

   Dakota Arms Professional Hunter
   Dakota Arms Professional Hunter o Price: $8,000

   The brand new Professional Hunter from Dakota Arms features their
   respected Model 76 action and a custom fiberglass stock with pillar
   bedding. Designed for the dangerous game hunter who values ruggedness
   over beauty, the rifle's 23-inch Premium Douglas barrel is Cerakoted
   and a quarter rib fixed sight and hooded fiber optic front sight are
   standard features. The cartridge options are vast and include the .450
   Dakota and .450 Rigby.
   Dakota Arms African Big Five

   Dakota Arms African Big Five
   Dakota Arms African Big Five o Price: $9,700

   An exquisite firearm by any measure, the Dakota Arms African Rifle is
   built on a stock made form XXX grade walnut, with a shadow line
   cheekpiece, and is detailed with hand-cut checkering. It features a
   straddle floorplate with an inside release and a drop-belly magazine
   with a four-round capacity. It's available in a wide assortment of
   elephant-capable cartridges including the .450 Dakota.
   Heym âÂU80ÂU9CExpressâÂU80ÂU9D Magnum Bolt Action Rifle

   Heym "Express" Magnum Bolt Action Rifle
   Heym "Express" Magnum Bolt Action Rifle o Price: $13,000

   Elegance abounds with this bolt-action rifle from Heym. It is
   reminiscent of the best-grade English sporting rifles that were built
   between the great wars. The actions used are sized perfectly to the
   cartridge, with cartridge specific magazine boxes. The barrel, along
   with everything else, is made in house at Heym in Germany. The action
   features the famous Mauser claw extractor and true controlled feed
   design. A single stage trigger and 4+1 capacity Oberndorf-style
   drop-box magazine is standard. Cartridge options include the .375 H&H,
   .416 Rigby, .404 Jeffery, .458 Lott, and .450 Rigby.
   Krieghoff Classic Big Five Double Rifle

   Krieghoff Classic Big Five Double Rifle
   Krieghoff Classic Big Five Double Rifle o Price: $13,995

   Combining the heritage of traditional side-by-side design and the
   sophistication of modern manufacturing technology, the beautiful
   Krieghoff Classic Double rifle is available in the most common
   chamberings for an African safari or dangerous game hunting. It
   features a manual cocking device that allows carrying while fully
   loaded with the hammers uncocked. With options that include additional
   barrels you can more than double the price, as well as your cool
   factor, while sitting on the back of the Land Rover.
   Merkel 470 NE 140-2.1 SXS

   Merkel 470 NE 140-2.1 SXS
   Merkel 470 NE 140-2.1 SXS o Price: $14,275

   double rifle. The Merkel 470 NE 140-2.1 SXS is elegant, reliable, and
   responsive. It features a steel action, Greener-style cross bolts,

   ejectors, express sights, and a finely figured wood stock that looks as
   if it has a life of its own.
   Heym Model 88B Double Rifle

   Heym Model 88B Double Rifle
   Heym Model 88B Double Rifle o Price: $22,000

   For more than 35 years, the Heym 88B has been the company's flagship
   dangerous game rifle, and it's likely the most common double rifle in
   Africa. Handcrafted for a perfect fit and with a host of customizing
   options available, holding this rifle can make your knees feel weak.
   Built with Krupp steel hammer forged barrels and a triple lockup
   boxlock action, automatic ejectors and dual triggers are standard. This
   rifle will even handle the .577 Nitro Express.
   Rigby London Best Rifle

   Rigby London Best Rifle
   Rigby London Best Rifle o Price: $32,000 to $72,000

   When you can afford the very best of everything in life, a starting
   price of more than $32,000 won't cause you to blink an eye. What might
   make you order another drink are the options available on the Rigby
   London Best rifle. Grade 11 wood, H&H quick detach scope mounts, case
   hardening, engraving, the take-down option, and a custom case later,
   and you're on the other side of $72,000. But, you might have the finest
   bolt-action rifle in the world. If that doesn't impress the hippo
   you're facing, show him the receipt; maybe it will scare him to death.
   Rigby Rising Bite Double Rifle

   Rigby Rising Bite Double Rifle
   Rigby Rising Bite Double Rifle o Price: $136,000

   grand. A few customizations later you have created what might be the

   you ever hunt dangerous game or not--you can just sit by the fire ring
   and brag about it.

   desire, prices are available by request; which means if you have to
   ask, you don't have enough money.
