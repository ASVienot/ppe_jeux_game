Small Game Hunting

   Although there are many opportunities for hunting small game in
   Washington, small game hunting is not nearly as popular as big game
   hunting. Often, hunters pursue small game while they are hunting other
   species. Popular small game animals include bobcats, raccoons, rabbits
   and hares, foxes, and coyotes. Small game animals are found in all
   areas that offer suitable habitats. Hunting methods and techniques
   vary, depending upon hunter skill and knowledge.

   A hunting license is required to hunt all small game species. Some
   species, such as coyote, may be hunted year round with few exceptions.
   Other species, such as cottontails and raccoons, may be hunted only
   during established seasons.

License Information

   The small game license in Washington State allows the holder to hunt
   for wild animals and wild birds except big game. There are additional
   charges for turkey tags, western Washington pheasant permits, and
   migratory bird validations.
