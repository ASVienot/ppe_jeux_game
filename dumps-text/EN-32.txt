Why We Play Boardgames

   My husband and I have spent the last ten years playing board games
   together. No, I’m not talking about seeing if we need anger management
   classes by playing Monopoly or choosing which career path we want to
   pursue in Life. I’m talking about making the life or death decision of
   which city to cure of a disease lest an outbreak occur in Pandemic,
   cackling like a maniac when you oust your opponent with a direct hit of
   four attack strikes to become the baddest monster in King of Tokyo, and
   smartly building and managing the best winery in pre-modern Tuscany in
   Viticulture.

   The world of board gaming has changed so much since the days of
   Monopoly, Life, and Battleship. When my husband and I started dating,
   we weren’t really into the “typical” dates. Rather than dinner and a
   movie or going to college parties, we spent the majority of our time
   together learning card games, and teaching each other our family
   favorites. When we tired of Canasta and Sequence, we began looking for
   something new and stumbled into the world of hobby board gaming. We
   started out slow like a swimmer testing the water, and over the years
   have dove head first into the deep end where our hobby has grown into
   shelves full of games that have brought us, our family, and our friends
   closer together through hours spent laughing, playing, and enjoying
   each others company over the many different games brought to the table.

   While this is definitely a hobby of ours, over the years and as our
   family has grown, it has morphed into a passion of sorts. There are so
   many reasons why we love board gaming and why we have made it an
   important part of our family for us and our four kids. We think that
   every family can benefit by incorporating board games into their lives.
   Yes, I know that may sound a bit nerdy, but here us out.

   Family Bonding

   Juggling the commitments of a family is no joke. As a parent you are
   pulled in every direction from sun up to sun down – from work, school,
   running a household, and getting everyone to their events on time
   things can get a little hectic. Our lives get so busy and scheduled
   that we decided it was important that, like we do for dance and soccer,
   we make sure to actually schedule time for our family to just be
   together and bond; no places to be except home with each other. We use
   this time to play games with our kids. Now, our kids are young, so it’s
   not always as idyllic as we go into it hoping it will be. But what we
   see is our kids engaged with each other learning to take turns, follow
   rules, make tough choices, and win or lose graciously. Its time spent
   making memories and connecting with each other. Rather than sitting and
   watching a show, they are working together to solve problems and
   complete goals all in a fun, controlled setting. If there’s one thing
   we hope our kids look back on fondly as adults and incorporate into
   their own lives, its the importance of spending meaningful time
   together and finding joy in simple fun, whether that comes from a board
   game or not.

   Games also allow us to have great date nights at home. Finding a sitter
   for four kids 6 and under can be hard, and after paying for the sitter,
   dinner, and perhaps a movie, we’ve racked up quite the bill. While we
   try to get out as often as we can, we also try to make sure that for
   when we can’t we are still making time for us to be together and pursue
   one another. We’ll put the kids to bed, come downstairs, and for a few
   hours we’ll take time to play a game. Maybe we’ll even spend what we
   would have spent on a date and get a new game to enjoy; when it comes
   to bang for your buck, you can’t beat buying a board game that you will
   be able to enjoy a countless number of times rather than just once.

   Less Screen Time

   Like most families, we are looking for ways to decrease the screen time
   in our family. And I’m not just talking about our kids’. Technology is
   quickly taking over every aspect of our lives, we have the ability to
   have “smart” everything: smart phones, smart TVs, smart lightbulbs,
   smart toothbrushes (yes, seriously,) smart speakers and on and on! The
   pull of technology is everywhere and everyone has an opinion on what
   amount is good and what isn’t. I’m no expert on that, and I engage in a
   fair amount of “plugged-in” entertainment myself, but what I do know,
   is that as technology has taken over more of my life, I am looking for
   more and more ways to unplug. When we spend a night engaged in a board
   game, we walk away with memories, laughs, and a fun experience that can
   only come from face-to-face social interaction. Board games are
   incredibly versatile; you can take them with you to play indoors or
   out, and they open the door for a wonderful social experience with your
   friends and family where you can enjoy some friendly competition or
   even cooperative play and still engage in the great conversation that
   we all long for.

   Brain Food

   You’d be surprised by the level of mental engagement required to play
   modern board games. In games like Candyland, the winner is already
   determined before the first card has even been flipped – there is
   nothing you can do. But in today’s board games you have a variety of
   styles, from puzzles to tactical area control games to keep you and
   your brain sharp and always thinking. The challenges provided by
   physical board games are better than anything you’ll find in some app,
   even apps of the board games you might be playing.

   The strategy required to play and win requires you to make touch
   choices and weigh your options, to look at the board and think not only
   about what the best move for you is, but also the best move for your
   opponent and how to block them. Or they invite you to work together to
   solve problems as you play cooperatively. And thats to say nothing of
   the reading and language skills required to interpret the rules,
   hand-eye dexterity enhancment, and math skills required to play the
   game itself.  Whether you’re playing a difficult strategy game or a
   light hearted party game, there are an endless number of options that
   invite you to think through a variety of mental challenges, making you
   perhaps just a bit smarter along the way.

   Something for Everyone

   As mentioned above, we have been hobbyist board gamers for the last ten
   years, which seems kind of crazy thinking about it. But over the years
   this really has developed into a passion for us. We board game for many
   reasons, more than even listed above, but the main reason is, without a
   doubt, for the experiences it provides between us and our family and
   friends. We love being able to gather round a table, phones aside, and
   spend time connecting with people, old friends and new. The board game
   is really just a vehicle for us to bring people together and enjoy each
   others company. Over the last ten years we’ve had our fair share of
   friends and family that have told us that they “don’t like board games”
   and time and time again, we’ve found that there truly is something for
   everyone in this hobby.

   You don’t have to like every game, we certainly don’t, but the
   diversity offered by today’s games is simply incredible and if you’ve
   made it this far down this post and are wondering where to start, then
   you’re in luck! What would a post about the benefits of board gaming
   with your family be if we didn’t give at least a few suggestions. This
   hobby is truly a joy and is something that we love to share with anyone
   who will let us and especially our kids who have no choice! So without
   further ado, here are some board game ideas to get you started!

   Happy Gaming!

   Ticket to Ride

   This game has really broken through the hobby wall and has become much
   more mainstream over the years, you may have even seen it in your local
   Target. This game is simple to learn, but far more layered in its
   tactical strategy. Players collect cards of various types of train cars
   that they then use to claim railway routes across North America. The
   longer the route, the more points earned. Along the way you try to
   complete Destination Tickets, secret routes connecting distant cities
   that will score you more points at the end of the game. You must
   balance greed as you take on more routes to earn more points, and fear
   as you might lose a critical route to a competitor and thus cost
   yourself points in the end.

   This game has a multitude of expansions offering different train maps
   featuring different countries and states, but we recommend the original
   game with the North American map to start and it is great for the whole
   family starting at about age 8.

   Pandemic

   More of a cooperative player? Great! You might love Pandemic! In this
   game several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all
   across the globe and it is your mission to fight these while
   researching cures before they take over the world. Players take on
   unique roles as disease-fighting specialists, each with their own
   powers and capabilities and must strategize together to decide where
   help is needed most and find a way to control the contagions before the
   situation gets out of hand.

   This game is incredibly fun and endlessly re-playable. Start at a
   beginners difficulty level, once you’ve mastered that, work your way up
   to expert and see if you’ve got what it takes. This is a great way to
   work on your kids’ problem solving skills and is best for gamers of all
   ages starting at age 10.

   King of Tokyo

   If you know how to play Yahtzee you can play this game, promise! King
   of Tokyo is a hit with everyone as players take on the role of mutant
   monsters, robots, and aliens all trying to destroy the other and become
   the lone remaining King of Tokyo. You roll six dice Yahtzee style,
   setting what you want to keep aside, and rolling the rest up to two
   more times in an effort to either win victory points, gain energy,
   restore your health, or attack other players to let them know Tokyo
   belongs to YOU. But be warned, if you stand inside Tokyo, you must face
   all the other monsters alone as they attempt to knock you off your
   thrown.

   With a little help from an adult, King of Tokyo can easily be played by
   gamers as young as 6, but don’t let that deter you, this is far from a
   kid game and will offer tons of fun for teens and adult gamers as
   well.

   Survive: Escape from Atlantis!

   Survive is a simple, yet cutthroat game where players try to evacuate
   their pieces from an island that is breaking up while remembering where
   their highest-valued pieces are located to maximize score. The journey
   to shore is anything but simple however as players must navigate waters
   filled with boat tipping whales, fast moving sharks, and fearsome sea
   monsters. Find out who your true friends are as you all attempt to
   sabotage each other’s escape plans so you can stand victorious with the
   most points on shore before the island blows up. This game plays up to
   four and works well for ages 6 and above.
