How to Win the Blame Game

   People are often more concerned about avoiding blame than achieving
   results. But blame can actually be a potent positive force in the
   workplace. The trick, says this former Major League Baseball pitcher,
   is knowing how to use it.

   When a new product flops in the marketplace or a recent hire turns out
   to be the employee from hell, blaming somebody for the mistake seems,
   well, just a tad rude. So people talk politely around the blunder,
   saying things like “sales targets were missed” or “mistakes occurred,”
   as if the error happened all by itself. Indeed, at many companies,
   blame is the proverbial elephant in the middle of the room that people
   pretend isn’t there. At other organizations, people are all too quick
   to point fingers, leaving employees more concerned about avoiding blame
   than about achieving results. Such organizations, ruled by “CYA,” have
   given blame a bum rap.
   A version of this article appeared in the July–August 2001 issue of
   Harvard Business Review.
