   Thinking of party games may bring to mind memories of Pin the Tail on
   the Donkey and piñatas, but there are so many more party game ideas out
   there that won't make you feel like a kid again. Like road trip games,
   clever party games can be tailored to the crowd playing them, and these
   ideas are practically guaranteed to make sure everyone has a great
   time.

   If there's no room in your party-planning checklist for game time,
   that's fine. (Sometimes, great conversations and catching up with
   distant friends are all a successful gathering needs.) But if you would
   rather fill your holiday party with laughter and activity, or if you
   need to keep little ones entertained, these people-pleasing party games
   have you covered.

   Because these games have flexible rules and little to no supplies, you
   can keep them casual and make them work for any event, whether it's a
   birthday party, a holiday celebration, or an intimate gathering around
   a small dining table. Most can work for adults or kids, depending on
   what rules you play by. They're all great for families, so you have
   something to do after your gift exchange ideas and games or
   Thanksgiving feast besides gathering around the TV.

   Pick a few party games that work for you, and keep them in mind for any
   gathering. They're so easy to explain and play that you can whip them
   out at a moment's notice if the party's energy begins to fall, saving
   your celebration from a tired fade-out.
   The Best Games for Entertaining at Home

Party games for any occasion and all ages

   1. Saran Wrap Game

   This one requires a little prep: You'll need a box of plastic wrap and
   a bag of candy, or an assortment of small, durable goodies. (Packs of
   gum, dollar bills, lottery tickets, and the like all work.) Pick one
   item to place at the center of your saran wrap ball. Wrap it thoroughly
   in plastic wrap, then add more items as your wrapped ball gets bigger,
   trapping them in layers of wrap. (To make the game more challenging,
   tear the wrap into smaller sheets as you go.) Once you've used a whole
   roll of wrap (or more, if desired), you're ready to play.

   Gather in a circle or around a table. Give one person the wrapped
   bundle; give the person next to them a pair of dice. The person with
   the saran wrap bundle must unravel as much of the ball as possible
   before the person with the dice rolls doubles. (Any prizes that fall
   out during your turn are yours to keep.) Once the person with the dice
   rolls doubles, they pass the dice down and receive the bundle. Repeat
   until the ball is completely unwound.

   For alternative versions, have the person with the plastic wrap ball
   wear oven mitts, or set a timer for each turn instead of using dice.

   2. Post It Note Game

   You'll need a stack of sticky notes and a pen. Write a name of a
   well-known public figure or character on each note, then pass them
   around until everyone has one. Without looking, each person should
   stick their note on their forehead or back. Have everyone mingle, or
   sit in a circle and take turns asking yes or no questions to discover
   your assigned identity. ("Am I living?" is a great place to start.)
   Play until everyone has correctly guessed their identity, or pass out
   prizes to those who guess correctly.

   3. How's Yours?

   Pick one person to be "It" and send them from the room. With the people
   remaining, select a common characteristic: hair, articles of clothing,
   or body parts all work. When the person returns, they'll ask someone,
   "How's yours?" That person should then give a one-word adjective to
   describe theirs. (Itchy, thick, and stretchy all work for shirts, for
   example.) Repeat until the person asking guesses the attribute being
   discussed.

   4. Most Likely To

   This party game works best for close groups of friends or family
   members. Gather in a circle. Begin with one person asking, "Who's most
   likely to trip over their own feet?" (Or another situation, trait,
   action, etc.) Count down from three (performing a drumroll with your
   hands is encouraged) and then have everyone point at who they think
   would be most likely to do said act. Whoever has the most fingers
   pointed at them is out. Go around the circle asking, "Who's most likely
   to…" until all but one person is out. You can skip the eliminations to
   make the game last longer.

   5. Never Have I Ever

   Sit in a circle. Begin with one person saying, "Never have I ever…" and
   finishing with something they have never done. (Traveled to Africa,
   eaten escargot, and the like all work.) If someone has done it, they
   must hold up one finger; if no one in the group has done it, the person
   saying "Never have I ever…" must hold up a finger. Continue around the
   circle until one person has three fingers up: They're out. This party
   game can get as racy as you make it, so play carefully and set ground
   rules ahead of time if sensitive grandparents, kids, or conservative
   guests are involved.

   6. Would You Rather?

   Gather in a circle. Ask the person next to you, "Would you rather…" and
   include two challenging situations. ("Would you rather not shower for a
   year or not brush your teeth for a year?" for example.) After their
   response, it's their turn to ask the person next to them. Continue
   until you can't think of any more scenarios.

   7. Heads Up!

   This game requires an app: The Heads Up! app is available from the App
   Store and Google Play. After the 99-cent purchase and download, though,
   you have hours of entertainment on-hand at all times. (In-app purchases
   are also available.) One person will hold a phone to their forehead,
   facing out. Everyone else will act out or describe whatever appears on
   the screen while the person with the phone guesses. They have one
   minute to make as many correct guesses as possible, and then the phone
   goes on to the next person. Categories include animals, movies, public
   figures and celebrities, and more.

   8. I'm Hosting a Party…

   For a more cognitive game, play this brain teaser. Say you're hosting a
   party, and only people who bring the right contributions are given an
   invitation. Pick a secret rule: Typically, everyone must bring
   something that begins with the same letter as their name, but you can
   also get more creative with it. Don't tell anyone else your rule.

   Go around the room and have each person say what they're bringing; you
   respond to each suggestion with a "Yes, you're invited," or "No, you
   can't bring that." Continue until everyone figures out the rule.

   9. Two Truths and a Lie

   Pick three statements about yourself: "I have two siblings, I've been
   to three continents, and I love cats," for example. Two should be true;
   one should be a lie. Everyone else must guess which is the lie, and
   then the next person goes. This is a great getting-to-know-you game; if
   you're playing with family or friends, pick obscure details to trick
   each other to make it even more fun.

   10. Sticker Stalker

   Purchase a pack of stickers. (This one is a great Christmas party game
   or Halloween party game, so try to find stickers that suit the
   occasion.) Give everyone one sheet of five to 10 stickers (or less,
   depending on the size of the party). This game works best at a party
   where everyone is mingling, so you can incorporate it easily into your
   happy hour or neighborhood function. Each person must discreetly place
   all their stickers on other party guests; the first to use all their
   stickers wins. If they get caught stickering someone, they must accept
   a sticker. At the end of the evening, you can laugh about how sneaky
   some people are—and wonder how you ended up with stickers all over your
   back without even noticing.

   11. Mail Call

   Place chairs in a circle, using one less than needed. Have everyone
   take a seat; the one person without a seat must stand in the center of
   the circle. They'll say, "Mail Call for everyone…" and pick a
   descriptor, such as "wearing red" or "has a cat." (There's a lot of
   room for creativity here.) Everyone that descriptor applies to must get
   up and find a new seat without retaking their initial seat or moving to
   the seats next to them. The person in the middle will also be racing
   for a chair; whoever is left standing at the end stands in the circle
   next, and the game continues.

   12. Spoons

   Find a deck of cards and a set of spoons. (Pieces of candy also work.)
   Have enough for each player, minus one. Deal four cards to each person
   playing. One person, the dealer, will keep the remaining deck next to
   them and draw one card at a time. They will look at the card and trade
   it out for a card in their hand or pass it along to the person next to
   them, who will do the same thing. The goal is to collect four of the
   same card; when that happens, reach for a spoon. When someone spots a
   spoon missing, they, too, can grab one; whoever is left without a prize
   at the end is out. Remove one more spoon and play again.

   Alternatively, play by sticking out your tongue when you've collected
   four of a kind. If others notice, they can stick out their tongues,
   too; whoever notices last loses.

   13. Camera Hot Potato

   Pick a phone to pass around the group. Set it to self-timer mode—10
   seconds is best—and use regular photo mode, not selfie mode. Pass the
   phone around, with each person holding the phone up for a moment,
   posing for the camera. Pass until the photo is taken, then repeat. At
   the end, take a look at the (probably undignified) photos.

   14. Crossed, Uncrossed

   This is a trickier take on I'm Hosting a Party. Sit in a circle and
   designate yourself as the host. (Just don't tell everyone the name of
   the game.) Say you are hosting a party but will only invite people
   bringing the right items. Go around the circle and have everyone
   suggest contributions; the host will say who is invited and who isn't.
   Instead of basing the invite on what they're bringing, though, base it
   on their posture: Whoever has their legs crossed can come, and whoever
   doesn't can't, for example. Continue until everyone figures it out.

   15. In a Perfect World

   Similar to I'm Hosting a Party and Crossed, Uncrossed, have everyone
   sit in a circle. Say you're describing your perfect world: "In my
   perfect world, there are doors but no windows." Have the next person
   describe what might be in your perfect world. Your perfect world has
   only double letter items: schools but not universities, for example, or
   apples but not bananas. If someone gets it right, say, "Yes, that would
   be in my perfect world." If they don't, say so. Continue around the
   circle until everyone figures it out.

   16. Thumper

   Have everyone sit or stand in a circle. Each person should select a
   hand motion (or leg motion, if you're standing). Go around the circle
   and have everyone present their motion. Memorize these. Have everyone
   begin clapping or stomping a steady rhythm and pick one person to
   start: They will do their motion and then the motion of someone else in
   the circle. This next person will do their own motion, then the motion
   of a third person, who will do the same. There are no passbacks and no
   hesitations. Whoever messes up first is out; continue indefinitely.

   17. Straight Face

   Find a pad of paper and writing tools. Have everyone write an
   outrageous phrase on a slip of paper, and collect everything in a hat.
   (If it's a mixed group, set propriety guidelines ahead of time; if it's
   adults-only, go wild.) Gather in a circle. Give one person the hat.
   They must draw a piece of paper and read the statement aloud to the
   group. The goal is to keep a straight face. Whoever laughs or smiles
   loses. Pass the hat around until everything has been read.

   18. Medusa

   Have everyone sit around a table. Everyone will put their heads down;
   count down from three, and have everyone sit up and look at someone
   else in the circle. If you make eye contact with someone else, you're
   out. If the person you're looking at is looking at someone else, you're
   safe. Repeat until everyone is out.

   19. Mr. Freeze

   Pick one person to be Mr. Freeze. Have everyone playing the game move
   around the party as usual. When Mr. Freeze freezes, though, everyone
   else must freeze too. Whoever freezes last is out. Repeat for the
   duration of the party.

Oldies but Goodies

   20. Musical Chairs

   Okay, it's a popular party game for kids, but adults can also get in on
   the fun. Set up chairs (or seat cushions) in a circle facing outward,
   with enough seating for everyone playing, minus one. Designate one
   person as the music player and have everyone else stand in a circle
   around the circle of seats. When the music starts, walk around the
   seats; everyone must find a seat when the music ends. Whoever doesn't
   is out. Remove one more chair and begin again, until two people are
   fighting for one seat. To make musical chairs more interesting, add
   your own rules. Allow people to sit on top of each other (as long as
   their feet are off the floor), for example, or make your own
   alterations.

   21. Charades

   This tried-and-true party game can be as simple or as complicated as
   you make it. Have everyone write down concepts, movies, people, shows,
   and more to act out and divide into teams. One person will act out
   something drawn from the assortment while their team members guess what
   it is. When time is up, switch teams and repeat. Add time limits,
   scoring systems, silence rules, and more as desired.

   22. Telephone

   Gather in a circle. Pick one phrase to whisper in the ear of the person
   next to you—no repeats. That person will whisper what they heard to the
   person next to them, and so on until the phrase gets back to you.
   Prepare to laugh at how distorted it gets. To make it more difficult,
   play music in the background.

   23. 20 Questions

   Pick one person to go first. That person will think of an item, animal,
   movie, public figure, etc. Everyone else will ask yes-or-no questions
   about what or who they are; they have 20 chances to guess, or the other
   person wins. Whoever guesses correctly can win a prize, or be the next
   to answer questions.
   9 Virtual Games to Play When You Can't Be Together

How to make any party game a drinking game

   For adults, if you want things to get a little wild, just add alcohol.
   For most games, instead of someone being "out" after losing, have them
   take a sip of their drink (or a shot, if you're feeling particularly
   rowdy). In games involving rule-making (Kings, Cheers to the Governor,
   etc.), any rule can be turned into an instruction to drink: Women
   drink, men drink, people wearing black drink, etc. If you are
   introducing drinking games to your gathering, drink responsibly, and
   stay safe. (And don't forget to offer non-alcoholic mocktail options
   for designated drivers and people who are staying sober.)

Party games for adults

   24. Telephone Pictionary

   Tear or cut sheets of paper into pieces, or give each person playing a
   notepad, and pass around pens or pencils. Each person should have as
   many pieces of paper or pages as people playing: If it's a group of 10,
   each person should have 10 pieces of paper, for example.

   Without letting anyone else see, write a word or phrase on the first
   piece of paper. Everyone should pass their stack of papers or notepad
   clockwise. The next person will look at the word or phrase, move it to
   the bottom of the stack, and then draw their interpretation of that
   word or phrase. Once everyone is finished, pass clockwise again. This
   person will look at the picture and interpret it into a word or phrase,
   moving the drawing to the bottom of the stack. Continue passing,
   alternating between drawings and words, until the stacks have gone full
   circle. Flip through the results, and prepare to roar with laughter.

   25. Mafia

   This game is also known as Assassin, Werewolf, or Village. If you have
   a large group, a deck of cards, a lot of time, and long attention
   spans, this intense puzzle of a game is a lot of fun, if a little
   complicated. See the full rules for Mafia; essentially, certain members
   of the group are the bad guys (the mafia, assassins, etc.); others are
   villagers, and still more are police officers. One is the game
   moderator. The police officers are trying to guess who the bad guys are
   before they can kill all the villagers.

   26. Kings

   Shuffle a deck of cards and gather everyone around a table. Place a can
   of beer or soda in the center, and arrange the cards facedown around
   it. Follow the assigned rules for Kings or assign your own rules for
   each card. After drawing a card, slide it under the can's tab before
   performing the card's rule. When the can pops, whoever placed the last
   card must drink it.

Party games for kids (and kids at heart)

   27. I Spy

   Pick one person to go first. That person will pick something in the
   room and describe it: "I spy, with my little eye, something green."
   Everyone else will guess what it is, asking only yes or no questions.
   Whoever guesses correctly first can win a prize, or be the next Spyer.

   28. Connection!

   Find a ball of string or yarn. Have everyone stand in a circle. Pick
   one child to go first; give them the yarn and have them begin
   describing their life. When they say something ("I like dogs," for
   example) that someone else in the circle has in common, the second
   child will shout "Connection!" The first child will toss them the yarn,
   and the second child will begin describing their life. Repeat until
   everyone has gone, and the yarn has created a web between all the
   children.

   29. Minute to Win It Games

   If you've ever seen the old TV game show, these are funny physical or
   mental challenges that your party guests have to complete in under a
   minute (great for a lot of laughs). Think picking up Cheerios with a
   toothpick (and their mouths), reciting the alphabet backwards (without
   any mistakes!), sorting a big bowl of M&Ms or Skittles by color, or
   bouncing ping-pong balls into an egg carton.

   30. Limbo

   This time-honored party game lets kids try to see how low they can go.
   (All you need is a broom and some calypso music to make limbo happen!)
