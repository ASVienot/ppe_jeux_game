The Most Popular School Playground Games

   Children play many classic outdoor games on school playgrounds, many of
   which have been played for generations, and some are new for this
   generation of youngsters. Kids love playing, whether it's during
   recess, after school, on the weekend or all summer long.

   There are some games kids often play on playground equipment, whether
   it's making believe they're in a castle or mountain climbing. Kids have
   such active imaginations, though, that they can play games even when
   there's nothing but asphalt, blacktop or a sidewalk to play on.

   Academic studies are certainly important, but playing games at school
   is just as helpful for growth and learning. Games help kids stay in
   shape, develop their creative abilities and build social skills -- what
   could be better?

Top Games To Play On A School Playground For Kids in the United States

   It would be impossible to list all the different types of children's
   playground games, especially when you consider all the children's games
   worldwide. The following list, however, includes many simple and
   classic outdoor playground games that children have played in
   schoolyards for generations:

Young girl playing dodgeball Young girl playing dodgeball

1. Dodge Ball

   Dodge Ball is a great game to get students active. Two evenly-numbered
   teams line up their dodgeballs in the middle of a court and retreat to
   each end. On the signal, they rush to the center to grab a ball and
   throw it at opposing players, eliminating them from the game. The team
   that eliminates all players from the other team wins the game.

2. Double Dutch

   A popular jump rope game, Double Dutch, requires at least three people.
   Two players swing jump ropes in opposite directions, while the third
   player jumps between them without disrupting them. Players often chant
   or sing a rhyme to help time the jumps. This is a great game to teach
   kids to coordinate with others.

3. Heads Up Seven Up

   Heads Up Seven Up is a classic classroom game in which seven "choosers"
   make their way around a group of players who have their heads down and
   one thumb raised. Each chooser taps one thumb, and the players try to
   guess who touched their thumb. If they guess correctly, they swap
   places with their chooser.

4. Hopscotch

   An excellent way for children to improve their balance and hand-eye
   coordination, hopscotch involves a series of numbered squares drawn in
   a grid on the pavement. Children must throw an object into one of the
   squares and retrieve it using a sequence of hops without touching the
   lines.

5. I Spy

   One player chooses an object and says, "I spy with my little eye,"
   giving a description of the item like its color. Players take turns
   guessing what the item is. Use this game to help students develop their
   investigative skills.

6. Jacks

Jack Playground Game Jack Playground Game

   Another great game to play on the playground is jacks. Players need
   jacks and a small rubber ball for jacks. Players bounce the ball on the
   ground and catch a set number of jacks in the opposite hand,
   progressing until they make a mistake, at which point their opponent
   takes a turn. The first player to progress through the series of throws
   and catches wins.

7. Jump Rope

   A good game for a single child or a team, jump rope has nearly endless
   variations. Players swing and jump over a rope, seeing how many jumps
   they can make without touching it.

8. Kickball

   Kickball is one of the most popular outdoor games for kids. The game is
   similar to baseball, except players kick a dodge ball instead of
   swinging a bat.

9. Red Rover

   Two teams line up and link arms to form a chain. Players take turns
   calling over a player from the other group using the "Red Rover" chant.
   That player must break the chain or join the team.

10. Mother, May I

   The player designated as Mother stands with their back to the rest, who
   request to take various movements, like two crabwalk steps or five
   hops, toward Mother. Mother grants them permission, or not, until they
   are tagged.

11. Red Light, Green Light

   Red Light, Green Light is a great way to teach students about following
   directions. One player is "it" and faces away from the rest of the
   players lined up several yards down the field. When the player who is
   "it" shouts "green light," the others move toward them and try to tag
   them. However, the player who is "it" can also yell "red light" when
   they turn toward the other players. If they catch another player moving
   on a "red light," the player is eliminated.

12. Hot Potato

   Don't have a hot potato on hand? No problem! Students can play hot
   potato on the playground with a ball or soft object. Students stand in
   a circle and pass the ball. If they drop it, they are out. The game
   continues until there is only one player standing.

   If you have access to music, you can play the music and pause it at
   various intervals. In this case, the person holding the ball when the
   music stops is also out.

13. Charades

   Charades is an excellent way for kids to use their imagination. To make
   gameplay simple, you will need 2 small containers and some paper
   scraps.

   To play, divide your students into 2 teams. Ask each student to write a
   word or phrase on a scrap of paper and place it in the other team's
   bowl. You can boost the education factor by incorporating characters
   from class readings or vocabulary words. Then, allow one player at a
   time to draw a paper from their team's bowl and attempt to act out the
   phrase using hand signals and body motions. No speaking aloud! The team
   that guesses the most terms correctly wins!

The Benefits of Kids Games

   With childhood obesity rising in America, active games are particularly
   important for kids to play. Activities that utilize playground
   equipment, jump ropes or other body movements help get kids moving.
   When kids are inactive during their recesses at school and spend their
   free time at home playing video games and watching TV instead of going
   outside, they are developing behaviors that could hold them back for
   the rest of their lives.

   Games that rely on children's brains and encourage teamwork are equally
   beneficial because they help to strengthen mental and social
   skills that will come in handy as they enter middle school, high
   school, college and the job market. The games that kids play on the
   school and park playground offer many benefits, whether they're
   creative games that use their imagination or active games that work out
   their body. Children should be encouraged to play these simple
   playground games as much as possible.
