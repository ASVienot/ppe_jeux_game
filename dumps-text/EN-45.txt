The Best Adult Board Games, According to Cool People

   Portrait of Dominique Pariso

   Board games are a great way to break the ice, whether you're at a party
   or hosting a get-together with folks you haven't seen in a while. But
   with so many options available -- from strategy board games to social
   ones that require singing or drawing -- it can be hard to find the
   right one for you and your friends. So while we've written about board
   games before -- including the best two-player board games, best family
   board games, and best board games for kids -- here, I've rounded up the
   24 best board games for adults, according to fellow Strategist
   staffers, contributors, and a variety of people who play them all the
   time.

Best overall party board game for adults

   Just One
   Just One
   From $48

   "Hands down, Just One is our favorite new party game," says Kelsey
   Demers, who runs the board-game blog the Tabletop Family. "It's simple
   to play, a breeze to teach, and utterly addictive." Word-association
   games are a great choice to play with friends in larger groups because
   they are "full of inside-joke possibilities and they let you make new
   memories by reliving old ones," explains Meeple Mountain founder Andy
   Matthews. The main objective, as the title suggests, is for players to
   help their teammates guess a word by suggesting "just one" word as a
   hint. Which sounds easy enough, but, as Matthews warns: "Watch out,
   duplicate words cancel each other out." A right answer scores your team
   one point, while a wrong answer docks two points, with the ultimate
   goal being to get as many points out of 13 as possible.

Best strategy game for adults

   Amigo 'Saboteur' Strategy Card Game
   Amigo `Saboteur' Strategy Card Game
   $10
   [DEL: $13 :DEL] now 23% off
   $10

   "The premise of Saboteur, an inexpensive, whimsically mining-themed
   game designed by Frederic Moyersoen and produced by German games
   company Amigo, is relatively simple: Players work toward a shared goal,
   but some of their number -- the saboteurs -- are secretly working
   against the majority, the miners," explains Strategist writer Erin
   Schwartz, who compares it to similar games like Mafia and Among Us.
   "Although Saboteur is a tabletop game, the basic unit of play is the
   same, which is talking to your friends to figure out who's working
   against the group." While the game can be played with as few as three,
   Schwartz finds its best for larger groups of five or more players, to
   keep things interesting. The game scales well to groups of different
   skill level and competitiveness, they add. "But with a group of
   seasoned liars and scammers, it can get downright Machiavellian with
   increasingly baroque tests of fidelity, side deals, and emotional
   appeals to the friends you intend to betray."

   If you're looking for a more entry-level strategy game, Ticket to Ride
   is an adventure-style game in which players attempt to cross the
   country and connect cities by building train routes. It is easy to pick
   up "but also offers a level of strategy and tactics just deep enough
   for competitive gamers to return to time and again," says Ian Ross, who
   runs the popular Instagram page Board Games As Art.

Best fast-paced strategy board game for adults

   Raccoon Tycoon
   `Raccoon Tycoon'
   $23
   $23

   Strategist senior writer Liza Corsillo discovered this game by way of
   her "strategy-game connoisseur" brother and it quickly became a family
   game-night staple. According to Corsillo, Raccoon Tycoon combines the
   fast play of Ticket to Ride with the social interaction of Settlers of
   Catan, "but is more engaging and fun to look at." Like Ticket to Ride,
   a player will win the game by collecting the most points, "but there
   are multiple ways to earn them -- amassing wealth and owning railroads,
   towns, or buildings -- so it's harder to get bored." Corsillo also
   notes that part of what sets Raccoon Tycoon apart is "the intricate,
   uncanny illustrations," designed by painter Annie Stegg. "Every time I
   play, I discover some clever detail that makes me laugh," she adds.
   "Another perk is that you can play with as few as two people or as many
   as five, and though you have to pay attention to multiple things at
   once, it's not so complicated that a beginner or child couldn't win on
   their first time playing."

Best adult board game for pop-culture fans

   Monikers
   `Monikers'
   [DEL: $30 :DEL] now 17% off
   $25

   "Based on the classic parlor game Celebrity, Monikers is a silly social
   affair for four to 20 friends," says Dylan Speed of Meeple Mountain.
   Players give clues to teammates, hoping they'll guess what's on the
   card which could be anything from a world-famous pop star to a brief
   viral sensation, or even an obscure concept like sausage fingers, he
   explains -- which makes it an excellent pick for pop-culture fans.
   "Over three rounds that allow progressively fewer words -- from
   unlimited, to one, to none (charades) -- everyone will shout and laugh
   their way through an evening of making nonsense and new inside jokes,"
   promises Speed.

   "Using only a couple words as clues, can you get your team to correctly
   guess your words?" Dr. Joey J. Lee, director of the Games Research Lab
   and coordinator of the M.A. Program in Design and Development of
   Digital Games at Teachers College, Columbia University, asks about the
   basic premise of this spy-themed Czech favorite. Similar to the basic
   elements of charades, players divide into two teams with one designated
   spymaster providing clues. By guessing the words correctly, players
   unveil the other teams' agents. The first to unmask all of its
   opponents' spies wins.

Best drawing-focused board game for adults

   Telestrations

   `Telestrations'
   [DEL: $20 :DEL] now 25% off
   $15

   "This is my favorite party game when mixing kids and adults," says
   Scott Cooper, owner of Seattle-based Blue Highway Games. A cross
   between Pictionary and telephone, each player attempts to draw the
   Telestration word they have been given. When the time is up, all
   players pass their sketch to the person next to them, who attempts to
   guess what has been drawn on the dry-erase board. Everyone then passes
   their guess -- which ideally matches the previous player's word -- to
   the next player, who is then tasked with drawing it. The game is
   finished once all of the boards have been returned to their original
   player. According to Dr. Michael James Heron of Meeple Like Us, a
   board-game-review site with a focus on accessibility, "It plays really
   quickly, has everyone laughing all of the time, and likely won't
   provoke a single argument." Kurt Refling of Meeple Mountain agrees:
   "The results are gut-bustingly funny."

   Corsillo is also a fan of the board-game edition of Wordle. Designed

   you can make up your own words while trying to stump your opponent,
   instead of relying on a randomized batch.

   Strategist contributor Lauren Guidry loves Dutch Blitz, which has been
   described as a kind of "very energetic solitaire." Guidry calls the
   dopamine hit from a quick game "euphoric," and says she'll often
   persuade her husband to play a few hands between meetings when they are
   working from home together. Dutch Blitz can also be played solo.

Best adult board game for game night

   'Wavelength' Game
   `Wavelength' Game

   [DEL: $40 :DEL] now 23% off
   $31

   The party game we recommended as a gift for a "34-year-old neurosurgeon
   son who is into Magic: The Gathering." The game is suitable for up to
   12 players and takes around a half hour to play. Players are split into
   two teams, with one player designated as the "psychic." The team must
   move a needle to the correct position on a dial. The "psychic" knows
   where said target is and then selects a card with a scale. The psychic
   then must give the team a clue to try to get them to place the needle
   correctly. For example: where, on a scale from hot to cold, would you
   place coffee? If the team is able to interpret the clue and position
   the needle, they win a point. The first team to score ten points wins.

   As our friends over at Vulture put it: "I can't think of the last time
   a new board game received the kind of widespread acclaim and mainstream
   attention as Wingspan, a game about birds and bird-watching that truly
   integrates its theme into gameplay and features beautiful artwork." The
   game incorporates over 150 species of birds and asks players to collect
   the best birds to add to your aviary. It's also a favorite among actual
   birders for its attention to detail and beautiful illustrations.

Best fast-paced card game for adults

   Bohnanza
   `Bohnanza'
   $20
   $20

   Strategist writer Lauren Ro, who admits she finds most board games
   "needlessly complicated and mind-numbingly boring," says Bohnanza
   converted her from a game skeptic to an enthusiast. "It's fun. It's
   fast. The artwork is delightful. Best of all, it's easy to learn, even
   for a dolt like me." The concept is simple enough: Each player is a
   bean farmer who plants different varieties of beans; players harvest
   their crops in exchange for gold, and the more beans you harvest, the
   more coins you collect. However, the game dictates that you play with a
   fixed hand, meaning you have to play it in the order the cards were
   dealt or drawn, which makes things a bit more complicated since your
   hand dictates which bean you can plant in each field at each turn.
   Players must then barter with one another to trade beans, which adds
   elements of strategy and negotiation to the gameplay. "I didn't think I
   could ever love a game, but this is the only one I actually look
   forward to playing and introducing to friends when there are four or
   more adults in my home," Ro says.

Best push-your-luck-style board game for adults

   The Quacks of Quedlinburg is one of board-game enthusiast and
   Cartamundi tabletop games ambassador Sean Amdisen-Cooke's "all-time
   favorite games" to play. "It's a push-your-luck-style game where
   players draw blindly from their ingredient bags," he says. Some
   ingredients will help you gain points and coins which you then spend on
   more resources. "But if you draw too many of the wrong ingredients,
   your pot will explode and you'll have to make the hard choice between
   getting only victory points or coins," which will put you behind your
   opponent, he explains.

   "Charterstone is a campaign-style game in which, over the course of 12
   games, you'll build and expand a village shared by you and your
   opponents by constructing buildings and unlocking new elements with
   each play," says Demers. "Consider it the board-game equivalent of a
   Netflix binge," she adds, because you won't be able to stop playing the
   game once you start. The branching storyline slowly grows more
   complicated, and by the end, after you've completed your 12-game
   campaign, "you will have a unique-to-you board game you can play again
   and again."

   If you find battling a fictional pandemic soothing compared with living
   through one, Pandemic, Greg May, owner of the Uncommons and Hex &
   Company, calls it a "stellar cooperative game." The main objective is
   for players to work together to stop the spread of four diseases and
   save the world. "This is considered a modern classic because it has a
   simple set of rules, it has a theme everyone can get into, and it is
   highly replayable," adds Ronny Alexander of the cooperative board-game
   review site Co-op Board Games.

   If you're looking for a "quick, snappy" game that is easy to pick up,
   but "still has a bit of substance to it," board-game blogger Eric Yurko
   suggests Cascadia. The goal of the game is to create a Pacific
   Northwest ecosystem by collecting different animals. And Yurko has one
   word to describe the work of game designer Randy Flynn: "exceptional."

   According to Yurko, Carcassonne is a "classic," which asks players to

   the complexity and fun come from its numerous expansions, making it a
   game you can play for years to come.

   `Patchwork'

   Patchwork, created by accomplished game designer Uwe Rosenberg, is one
   of the best two-player games for beginners. The game challenges players
   to strategically collect different pieces to create a quilt. May calls
   it "the perfect game for couples" that is sure to delight "fans of
   Blokus or Tetris." Cooper adds that although the rules are simple to
   understand and it only takes about 15 minutes to play, the "subtle
   strategy keeps it interesting." May agrees: "Games are usually quite
   close, and there are just enough layers to keep you coming back without
   dragging things out."

   Walsh also loves the party game Dixit, which he describes as "a great
   icebreaker of a game, fantastic for getting everyone interacting." It
   begins with one player being designated the storyteller; that player
   makes up a sentence based on the image on one of the cards in their
   hand. Then each player selects the card in their hand that best matches
   the sentence and gives it to the storyteller. The storyteller shuffles
   the cards and presents them to the other players, who place bets on
   which is the original card with the winners gaining points for correct
   guesses. As an added bonus, "the card artwork is beautiful,
   imaginative, and sometimes a little surreal," Walsh says.

   Another popular option is 7 Wonders, "a trading and resource-management

   describes as "a wonderful, evocative hike through the National Park
   System of America." Players take on the role of hikers as they navigate
   different trails, collecting memories of the different places they
   visit. The game is played in four rounds, each one representing one of
   the seasons with the trail tiles being rearranged before players begin
   the next round. The game features 48 unique illustrations from over 35
   artists, as well as 102 color-coded wood tokens that feature 12
   delicately carved animals native to the country's parks.

   "Fans of Risk should definitely give Scythe a try because of its
   fantastical art and beautiful miniatures," says May. Scythe takes place
   in a post-WWI dystopia where players have to vie for resources and
   land. Since the rules are complicated and the gameplay long, it's a
   good option for serious gamers who are looking for a game to go on for
   hours.

   together to play cards in ascending order. The twist? No one can talk

   Arkham Horror is "a rich storytelling experience filled with unique
   encounters, secrets to uncover, and a campaign that unfolds whether you
   win or lose," according to board-game designer Rob Sparks, who calls it
   "a great game to get lost in with a buddy." It blends together a
   traditional card game with role-playing elements as players take on the
   roles of two investigators -- each with their own set of strengths and
   weaknesses -- who attempt to solve the game's mysteries. "This
   experience of mystery and horror is totally worth your attention," he
   promises.
