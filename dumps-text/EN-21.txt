   Complete plan on how a game player will behave in every possible game
   situation
   For other uses of "Strategy", see Strategy (disambiguation).

   In game theory, a player's strategy is any of the options which they
   choose in a setting where the optimal outcome depends not only on their
   own actions but on the actions of others.^[1] The discipline mainly
   concerns the action of a player in a game affecting the behavior or
   actions of other players. Some examples of "games" include chess,
   bridge, poker, monopoly, diplomacy or battleship.^[2] A player's
   strategy will determine the action which the player will take at any
   stage of the game. In studying game theory, economists enlist a more
   rational lens in analyzing decisions rather than the psychological or
   sociological perspectives taken when analyzing relationships between
   decisions of two or more parties in different disciplines.

   The strategy concept is sometimes (wrongly) confused with that of a
   move. A move is an action taken by a player at some point during the
   play of a game (e.g., in chess, moving white's Bishop a2 to b3). A
   strategy on the other hand is a complete algorithm for playing the
   game, telling a player what to do for every possible situation
   throughout the game. It is helpful to think about a "strategy" as a
   list of directions, and a "move" as a single turn on the list of
   directions itself. This strategy is based on the payoff or outcome of
   each action. The goal of each agent is to consider their payoff based
   on a competitors action. For example, competitor A can assume
   competitor B enters the market. From there, Competitor A compares the
   payoffs they receive by entering and not entering. The next step is to
   assume Competitor B doesn't enter and then consider which payoff is
   better based on if Competitor A chooses to enter or not enter. This
   technique can identify dominant strategies where a player can identify
   an action that they can take no matter what the competitor does to try
   to maximize the payoff. This also helps players to identify Nash
   equilibrium which are discussed in more detail below.

   A strategy profile (sometimes called a strategy combination) is a set
   of strategies for all players which fully specifies all actions in a
   game. A strategy profile must include one and only one strategy for
   every player.

Strategy set[edit]

   A player's strategy set defines what strategies are available for them
   to play. A strategy profile is a list of strategy sets, ordered from
   most to least desirable.

   A player has a finite strategy set if they have a number of discrete
   strategies available to them. For instance, a game of rock paper
   scissors comprises a single move by each player—and each player's move
   is made without knowledge of the other's, not as a response—so each
   player has the finite strategy set {rock paper scissors}.

   A strategy set is infinite otherwise. For instance the cake cutting
   game has a bounded continuum of strategies in the strategy set {Cut
   anywhere between zero percent and 100 percent of the cake}.

   In a dynamic game, games that are played over a series of time, the
   strategy set consists of the possible rules a player could give to a
   robot or agent on how to play the game. For instance, in the ultimatum
   game, the strategy set for the second player would consist of every
   possible rule for which offers to accept and which to reject.

   In a Bayesian game, or games in which players have incomplete
   information about one another, the strategy set is similar to that in a
   dynamic game. It consists of rules for what action to take for any
   possible private information.

Choosing a strategy set[edit]

   In applied game theory, the definition of the strategy sets is an
   important part of the art of making a game simultaneously solvable and
   meaningful. The game theorist can use knowledge of the overall problem,
   that is the friction between two or more players, to limit the strategy
   spaces, and ease the solution.

   For instance, strictly speaking in the Ultimatum game a player can have
   strategies such as: Reject offers of ($1, $3, $5, ..., $19), accept
   offers of ($0, $2, $4, ..., $20). Including all such strategies makes
   for a very large strategy space and a somewhat difficult problem. A
   game theorist might instead believe they can limit the strategy set to:
   {Reject any offer ≤ x, accept any offer > x; for x in ($0, $1, $2, ...,
   $20)}.

Pure and mixed strategies[edit]

   A pure strategy provides a complete definition of how a player will
   play a game. Pure strategy can be thought about as a singular concrete
   plan subject to the observations they make during the course of the
   game of play. In particular, it determines the move a player will make
   for any situation they could face. A player's strategy set is the set
   of pure strategies available to that player.

   A mixed strategy is an assignment of a probability to each pure
   strategy. When enlisting mixed strategy, it is often because the game
   doesn't allow for a rational description in specifying a pure strategy
   for the game. This allows for a player to randomly select a pure
   strategy. (See the following section for an illustration.) Since
   probabilities are continuous, there are infinitely many mixed
   strategies available to a player. Since probabilities are being
   assigned to strategies for a specific player when discussing the
   payoffs of certain scenarios the payoff must be referred to as
   "expected payoff".

   Of course, one can regard a pure strategy as a degenerate case of a
   mixed strategy, in which that particular pure strategy is selected with
   probability 1 and every other strategy with probability 0.

   A totally mixed strategy is a mixed strategy in which the player
   assigns a strictly positive probability to every pure strategy.
   (Totally mixed strategies are important for equilibrium refinement such
   as trembling hand perfect equilibrium.)

Mixed strategy[edit]

Illustration[edit]

   In a soccer penalty kick, the kicker must choose whether to kick to the
   right or left side of the goal, and simultaneously the goalie must
   decide which way to block it. Also, the kicker has a direction they are
   best at shooting, which is left if they are right-footed. The matrix
   for the soccer game illustrates this situation, a simplified form of
   the game studied by Chiappori, Levitt, and Groseclose (2002).^[3] It
   assumes that if the goalie guesses correctly, the kick is blocked,
   which is set to the base payoff of 0 for both players. If the goalie
   guesses wrong, the kick is more likely to go in if it is to the left
   (payoffs of +2 for the kicker and -2 for the goalie) than if it is to
   the right (the lower payoff of +1 to kicker and -1 to goalie).
                              Goalie
                     Lean Left Lean Right
   Kicker Kick Left   0,  0    +2, -2
          Kick Right +1, -1     0,  0
    Payoff for the Soccer Game (Kicker, Goalie)

   This game has no pure-strategy equilibrium, because one player or the
   other would deviate from any profile of strategies—for example, (Left,
   Left) is not an equilibrium because the Kicker would deviate to Right
   and increase his payoff from 0 to 1.

   The kicker's mixed-strategy equilibrium is found from the fact that
   they will deviate from randomizing unless their payoffs from Left Kick
   and Right Kick are exactly equal. If the goalie leans left with
   probability g, the kicker's expected payoff from Kick Left is g(0) +
   (1-g)(2), and from Kick Right is g(1) + (1-g)(0). Equating these yields
   g= 2/3. Similarly, the goalie is willing to randomize only if the
   kicker chooses mixed strategy probability k such that Lean Left's
   payoff of k(0) + (1-k)(-1) equals Lean Right's payoff of k(-2) +
   (1-k)(0), so k = 1/3. Thus, the mixed-strategy equilibrium is
   (Prob(Kick Left) = 1/3, Prob(Lean Left) = 2/3).

   Note that in equilibrium, the kicker kicks to their best side only 1/3
   of the time. That is because the goalie is guarding that side more.
   Also note that in equilibrium, the kicker is indifferent which way they
   kick, but for it to be an equilibrium they must choose exactly 1/3
   probability.

   Chiappori, Levitt, and Groseclose try to measure how important it is
   for the kicker to kick to their favored side, add center kicks, etc.,
   and look at how professional players actually behave. They find that
   they do randomize, and that kickers kick to their favored side 45% of
   the time and goalies lean to that side 57% of the time. Their article
   is well-known as an example of how people in real life use mixed
   strategies.

Significance[edit]

   In his famous paper, John Forbes Nash proved that there is an
   equilibrium for every finite game. One can divide Nash equilibria into
   two types. Pure strategy Nash equilibria are Nash equilibria where all
   players are playing pure strategies. Mixed strategy Nash equilibria are
   equilibria where at least one player is playing a mixed strategy. While
   Nash proved that every finite game has a Nash equilibrium, not all have
   pure strategy Nash equilibria. For an example of a game that does not
   have a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies, see Matching pennies.
   However, many games do have pure strategy Nash equilibria (e.g. the
   Coordination game, the Prisoner's dilemma, the Stag hunt). Further,
   games can have both pure strategy and mixed strategy equilibria. An
   easy example is the pure coordination game, where in addition to the
   pure strategies (A,A) and (B,B) a mixed equilibrium exists in which
   both players play either strategy with probability 1/2.

Interpretations of mixed strategies[edit]

   During the 1980s, the concept of mixed strategies came under heavy fire
   for being "intuitively problematic", since they are weak Nash
   equilibria, and a player is indifferent about whether to follow their
   equilibrium strategy probability or deviate to some other
   probability.^[4] ^[5] Game theorist Ariel Rubinstein describes
   alternative ways of understanding the concept. The first, due to
   Harsanyi (1973),^[6] is called purification, and supposes that the
   mixed strategies interpretation merely reflects our lack of knowledge
   of the players' information and decision-making process. Apparently
   random choices are then seen as consequences of non-specified,
   payoff-irrelevant exogenous factors.^[5] A second interpretation
   imagines the game players standing for a large population of agents.
   Each of the agents chooses a pure strategy, and the payoff depends on
   the fraction of agents choosing each strategy. The mixed strategy hence
   represents the distribution of pure strategies chosen by each
   population. However, this does not provide any justification for the
   case when players are individual agents.

   Later, Aumann and Brandenburger (1995),^[7] re-interpreted Nash
   equilibrium as an equilibrium in beliefs, rather than actions. For
   instance, in rock paper scissors an equilibrium in beliefs would have
   each player believing the other was equally likely to play each
   strategy. This interpretation weakens the descriptive power of Nash
   equilibrium, however, since it is possible in such an equilibrium for
   each player to actually play a pure strategy of Rock in each play of
   the game, even though over time the probabilities are those of the
   mixed strategy.

Behavior strategy[edit]

   While a mixed strategy assigns a probability distribution over pure
   strategies, a behavior strategy assigns at each information set a
   probability distribution over the set of possible actions. While the
   two concepts are very closely related in the context of normal form
   games, they have very different implications for extensive form games.
   Roughly, a mixed strategy randomly chooses a deterministic path through
   the game tree, while a behavior strategy can be seen as a stochastic
   path. The relationship between mixed and behavior strategies is the
   subject of Kuhn's theorem, a behavioral outlook on traditional
   game-theoretic hypotheses. The result establishes that in any finite
   extensive-form game with perfect recall, for any player and any mixed
   strategy, there exists a behavior strategy that, against all profiles
   of strategies (of other players), induces the same distribution over
   terminal nodes as the mixed strategy does. The converse is also true.

   A famous example of why perfect recall is required for the equivalence
   is given by Piccione and Rubinstein (1997)^[full citation needed] with
   their Absent-Minded Driver game.

Outcome equivalence[edit]

   Outcome equivalence combines the mixed and behavioral strategy of
   Player i in relation to the pure strategy of Player i’s opponent.
   Outcome equivalence is defined as the situation in which, for any mixed
   and behavioral strategy that Player i takes, in response to any pure
   strategy that Player I’s opponent plays, the outcome distribution of
   the mixed and behavioral strategy must be equal. This equivalence can
   be described by the following formula: (Q^(U(i), S(-i)))(z) = (Q^(β(i),
   S(-i)))(z), where U(i) describes Player i's mixed strategy, β(i)
   describes Player i's behavioral strategy, and S(-i) is the opponent's
   strategy.^[8]

Strategy with perfect recall[edit]

   Perfect recall is defined as the ability of every player in game to
   remember and recall all past actions within the game. Perfect recall is
   required for equivalence as, in finite games with imperfect recall,
   there will be existing mixed strategies of Player I in which there is
   no equivalent behavior strategy. This is fully described in the
   Absent-Minded Driver game formulated by Piccione and Rubinstein. In
   short, this game is based on the decision-making of a driver with
   imperfect recall, who needs to take the second exit off the highway to
   reach home but does not remember which intersection they are at when
   they reach it. Figure [2] describes this game.

   Without perfect information (i.e. imperfect information), players make
   a choice at each decision node without knowledge of the decisions that
   have preceded it. Therefore, a player’s mixed strategy can produce
   outcomes that their behavioral strategy cannot, and vice versa. This is
   demonstrated in the Absent-minded Driver game. With perfect recall and
   information, the driver has a single pure strategy, which is [continue,
   exit], as the driver is aware of what intersection (or decision node)
   they are at when they arrive to it. On the other hand, looking at the
   planning-optimal stage only, the maximum payoff is achieved by
   continuing at both intersections, maximized at p=2/3 (reference). This
   simple one player game demonstrates the importance of perfect recall
   for outcome equivalence, and its impact on normal and extended form
   games.^[9]
