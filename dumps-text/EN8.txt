   Yes, you really can get paid to play video games.

   With the rise of Esports, Twitch, and professional gamers, there’s
   never been a better time to monetize your video game hobby.

   And the cool part is, you don’t have to be a pro. Even casual gamers
   are getting in on the action, and in this article I’ll break down some
   realistic ways to make money playing video games.

1. Group Video Game Classes for Kids

   One place to sell those group classes is Outschool. The K-12 online
   education platform has both academic and extracurricular classes.

   In the extracurricular category, video game classes are a hot seller.
   Why? Parents love the idea of a safe, nurturing online environment for
   their kids.

   I connected with Devyn Ricks, a mom of 4, in this video, where she
   reported earning up to $4000 a month playing video games on Outschool!

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hs98Xu83ves

   In a way, she’s getting paid to be an online friend to these kids.

2. Play-to-Earn Game Apps

   Several smartphone apps let you make money playing video games in your
   spare time. Here are a few of Side Hustle Nation’s top picks.

Bingo Cash

   The popular Bingo Cash game app turns classic bingo from a game of luck
   into a game of speed and skill.

   Each game only takes about 2 minutes to play, and you can earn
   real-world rewards and cash prizes (except in AR, IA, LA, SC, and WA).

   bingo cash app

   With over 5 million downloads, the app has earned mostly positive
   reviews (players call it fun and addicting). In the negative App Store
   reviews, the most common complaint is that the ads claiming you can win
   big money with little effort are misleading.

   As with all gaming apps, practice for free first. Then, never put more
   money at risk than you can afford to lose.

Rewarded Play (Android)

   With over 180,000 reviews and a 4.4-star rating in the Google Play
   store, Rewarded Play is another free, legit, and fun, “get paid to
   play” app.

   rewarded play app

   Rewarded Play is your one-stop app for casual games like Solitaire,
   Mahjong, Wheel of Fortune, Yahtzee, and more. As you play, choose your
   rewards and get your gift cards within 48 hours.

Solitaire Cash

   I played my fair share of Windows Solitaire growing up, so Solitaire
   Cash got my attention.

   solitaire cash app

   The well-rated Android and iOS (4.6-stars from over 250k App Store
   reviews) game app pits you against similarly-skilled solitaire players.
   Everyone receives the same deck, and top 3 players who finish with the
   most points win.

   Of course, I recommend practicing for free first!

   Solitaire Cash is free to download and play, but real money tournaments
   aren’t yet available in AZ, IN, IO, LA, ME, MT, SC, and WA.

Mistplay (Android)

   With more than 10 million downloads, Mistplay is an interesting app
   that rewards you for discovering and playing new games on your phone.

   mistplay app

   The more you play, the more “units” you earn. Then you can cash in
   those units for gift cards to your favorite stores.

   Check out the games with 3x or 4x unit “multipliers” to earn gift cards
   faster.

3. Video Game Testing

   Before video games get released to the general public, they go through
   quite a bit of play testing. This is where your vast experience comes
   into play!

   Knowing how a great game should work and providing that feedback to the
   developers can be super valuable.

   If you like game apps on your phone, KashKick may be worth a look. At
   press time, they were offering $90-120 to play certain games and reach
   specific milestones.

   kashkick get paid to play games

   Similarly, Cash Giraffe (Android only) connects you with new games that
   are trying to attract more players. The app tracks the time you spend
   playing and rewards you for hitting certain milestones.

   cash giraffe

   As you earn more Cash Giraffe tickets, you can cash out for gift cards
   or deposit directly into your PayPal account.

   While Cash Giraffe is relatively new, it’s earned positive feedback so
   far. With over 5M downloads, its rated 4.3-stars on the Google Play
   Store.

   In addition, some people actually turn game testing into their career!
   Most game companies hire quality assurance (QA) testers to spot bugs
   and other issues with games before they go on sale.

   A quick search on Indeed found a number of job postings with salaries
   ranging from $30,000-85,000 a year.

4. Video Game Coaching

   Video game coaching is a great option if you have a deep understanding
   and passion for specific games.

   You can instruct other gamers through tutorials, screen-sharing
   walkthroughs, and group classes. Wouldn’t it be cool to get paid to
   share your tips, tricks, and advice?

   On platforms like Gamer Sensei, you can set your own rates (typically
   $30/hour and up) and availability. But not all coaches who apply get
   accepted. While this keeps quality high on the platform, it can be
   discouraging if you’re just starting out.

   An alternative would be to set up some coaching gigs on Fiverr for your
   favorite games, or try and find clients locally.

   When creating your profile, put yourself in your potential customer’s
   shoes. Why should they hire you? What video game credentials do you
   have?

   Your rates will vary based on your experience, the popularity of the
   game, and competition.

   Most video game coaches charge by the hour — usually in the
   $20-200/hour range. However, you could earn even more with group
   classes.

5. All Skill Level Video Game Tournaments

   You’ve probably heard of elite gamers winning big prize money from
   top-level video game tournaments. GameChampions lets players of all
   skill levels in on the excitement.

   get paid to play video games with gamechampions

   They use a “Fair Play Guarantee” to match you with players of similar
   skill, and have paid out over $10 million in prizes so far.

   GameChampions is open to players 18 and older, but play-to-win money
   games aren’t available in all geographic areas. The company will give
   you a $5 sign-up bonus when you create your account.

6. Video Game Reporting

   Another way to make money through your love of playing video games is
   to become a video game journalist.

   The role involves reporting on video game news, upcoming games, writing
   game reviews, and even reporting from e-sport tournaments.

   The two most common paths to get paid here are either as a staff writer
   for a gaming publication or as a freelancer. Your earning potential
   ranges from from $26,000 to $100,000 a year depending on your
   experience, writing skills, and portfolio.

7. Start a Video Game YouTube Channel

   YouTube is still a popular platform that you can make money playing
   video games. Several avid gamers have created their own YouTube channel
   and stream their live gameplay or broadcast recorded videos that rely
   on followers and subscribers.

   Video Game Coaching, Reporting, And Testing

   In addition to streaming, you can create:
    1. gameplay tutorials
    2. engaging video game reviews
    3. helpful gameplay tips

   Followers can recommend you to their gaming friends and the revenue can
   quickly become substantial. Video game YouTubers monetize with a
   combination of:
     * YouTube ad income
     * Affiliate marketing
     * Brand partnerships and sponsorships
     * Viewer support and donations
     * Merchandise and product sales

   Typical advertising income for video game channels may be $3-5 for
   every 1,000 views. With a popular channel, that can add up fast!

   Another common monetization strategy on YouTube is to make product
   recommendations, and use your affiliate link in the description. That
   way, you’ll earn a commission when anyone buys through your link.

8. Stream on Twitch

   Twitch has become one of the most popular sites for gaming across the
   globe. It’s the go-to site for video gamers to earn money streaming
   their gameplay.

   As your following grows, you’ll start to earn subscription and donation
   revenue. Top streamers make 6- and even 7-figures a year!

   Twitch works best if you’re either very good at a certain game, and/or
   very entertaining to follow. Remember, you’re competing your followers’
   for limited attention, so the content needs to be really compelling.

   And similar to YouTube, as you gain trust and build a relationship with
   your audience you can monetize with donations, merch, brand deals, and
   more.

9. Crypto Gaming

   The rise of cryptocurrency and NFTs have opened up another revenue
   stream for video gamers.

   For example, in Axie Infinity, gamers raise, trade, and battle NFT pets
   known as Axies. As you level up, your characters become more and more
   valuable — and can be bought and sold.

   The in-game currency, Axie Infinity Shards, can then be bought or sold
   on exchanges like Coinbase.

   Crypto gaming is definitely an area to keep an eye on.

10. Create Video Game Guides

   Years ago, a friend of mine was making thousands of dollars a month
   selling a Minecraft guide on Amazon. He’d self-published the book, had
   no audience, but people searching “Minecraft” on Amazon found it and
   bought it.

   Video game guides or tutorials can show others how to complete tricky
   levels or improve their gameplay. It’s another way to convert your
   expertise into cash.

   After you’ve created the guides, you can post them on your social
   media, upload them to YouTube, or sell the whole bundle as an online
   course.

   This isn’t a video game example, but may still be relevant. Kat Norton
   created TikTok tutorials on how to use Excel better. Those went viral,
   and she ended up putting together an in-depth training program on Excel
   and other Microsoft products. (And turned those into a wildly
   profitable business!)

   Could you do the same for your favorite game?

11. Sell Merchandise

   As a gamer, you you know that a love of video games can be part of your
   identity. That’s why game-themed or game-inspired merch can be such a
   hit.

   If you have some design skills, take a look at sites like Etsy and
   Redbubble to see what’s selling. You may not be allowed to use licensed
   characters in your design, but you can get creative to sell other
   products gamers would love.

   make money selling video game merch on redbubble

   Thanks to print on demand technology, you don’t have to carry any
   inventory or deal with shipping. Simply upload your designs, set your
   prices, and the platforms take care of the rest.

   Another angle would be to partner with popular streamers to make merch
   for their fans. Do they have a particular inside joke or catchphrase
   that would make a fun shirt? Reach out with your design samples and see
   if they’d be open to splitting revenue with you.

12. Build Your Own Video Game or App

   How cool would it be to have your own popular game on the App Store? If
   you don’t have coding or game design experience, you can learn from
   top-rated courses like this one.

   Developers earn a 70% royalty on any sales of the app or in-app
   purchases. For a popular game, that can turn into a serious income
   stream.

   Sometimes the biggest hits are the simplest. Take Wordle for example,
   where you have 6 chances to guess a 5-letter word. Creator Josh Wardle
   sold it to The New York Times just a few months after starting it for
   more than $1 million!

   Should the proposal be a hit, you can use your own gaming skills to
   develop the game you have always wanted to play.

13. Be a Video Game Developer

   Be A Video Game Developer

   Your skills as a gamer can also be used behind the scenes as a video
   game developer. Becoming part of the video game industry itself can be
   a lucrative career choice and a video game developer is an in-demand
   skill.

   In this role, you’ll be responsible for turning game ideas into reality
   through code and collaboration. Plus, per ZipRecruiter, game developers
   earn an average of $100,000 a year.

14. Teach Video Game Design

   If you already have some experience in how video games are made, you
   could turn around and teach others. Instructors can make money teaching
   video game design techniques and basic coding vocabulary and concepts.

   If you like working with kids, take a look at Outschool. Here you’ll
   create an engaging class for future game designers and developers.

   If your content is better for adults, you might create a pre-recorded
   class for Udemy or Skillshare. For every student who joins, you’ll earn
   a small royalty, with top instructors earning thousands of dollars a
   month.

15. Be a Professional Gamer

   Do you have the skills to go pro? There are video game tournaments
   across the globe, often with serious prize money on the line.

   Choose a game you know you’re great at, look for some local or online
   tournaments to get experience, and keep leveling up.

   While elite-level gamers earn millions of dollars, the majority are
   just scraping by. This is similar to professional sports or acting,
   where the average income is quite low, but the pursuit of getting paid
   to do what you love is a huge draw.

16. Become an E-Sports Star

   ESports — short for electronic sports — is a form of competition where
   you can earn prizes by playing video games.

   The typical format involves professional players that compete against
   each other individually or as part of a team in a multiplayer contest.
   The increasing popularity of esports has a lot to do with how streaming
   has developed in the last decade or so.

   As more gamers want to see competitions featuring their favorite games,
   more game developers have started competitions to showcase their games
   and provide funding for those tournaments.

   Typically, the games that are involved in competitions are first-person
   shooters, multiplayer online battle arenas, battle royale, fighting,
   real-time strategy, and sports.

   If you excel in competition and need to push the boundaries in a
   particular game or format then there are several e-sport franchises to
   choose from. These include Dota, Counter-Strike, League of Legends,
   Valorant, Overwatch, Super Smash Bros., StarCraft, and Street Fighter.

   Huge tournaments like the League of Legends World Championship and
   Intel Extreme Masters attract a big audience and even bigger paydays
   for the winners.

Getting Paid to Pay Video Games: Final Thoughts

Frequently Asked Questions

How Can I Get Sponsors For My Video Game Playing?

   Once you establish a following for your video game playing, consider
   contacting sponsors directly. Focus on specific brands you’re already a

   the popularity and quality of your content on YouTube or Twitch.

How Much Do Customer Service Representatives Make When Working For Video Game
Companies?

       One of the apps that let me earn a decent amount of money is
       Paidwork. I’ve found it a couple months ago, I believe back when
       it’s name was still Zareklamy. Anyway, the app has a huge following
       and great amount of positive ratings. You can earn money in
       Paidwork by playing mobile games, filling surveys, watching videos,
       creating accounts and doing online shopping. I’d recommend it
       myself to at least give it a try, I’ve tried and I’m happy about it
