5 Games to Play With Your Dog

   Published: 7/17/2017· (BUTTON) Share this article
   Dog Games Dog Games

   One of the best parts of being a dog owner is finding fun and
   constructive games for dogs. Engaging in physically and mentally
   stimulating exercise with your dog is a great way to keep them healthy.
   It also strengthens your bond.

   Whether it’s games to play with your dog inside or outside, teaching
   your dog interactive games with treats as a reward or discovering
   mental games for dogs, there are many ways to keep your dog (and you)
   entertained virtually anywhere

Games for Dogs

1. Fetch

   Almost every dog gets excited over a game of fetch, as it’s a classic
   game for humans and dogs alike. All you need is a yard, park or field,
   a tennis ball or frisbee and an enthusiastic dog to have some fun.

   Fetch is an excellent game for energetic dogs. It provides plenty of
   physical exercise while helping them fulfill their instinct to run. It
   can also keep your dog mentally engaged and challenged by trying
   different objects for him to run after. For example, a frisbee may be a
   bit trickier to catch yet more fun to snag in midair.

   Try adjusting the height, distance and direction of your throws to keep
   your dog interested. Don’t forget to praise your dog each time they
   return their toy to you so you can toss it one more time.

2. Tug of War

   Another classic game most dogs love is playing tug of war. Great for
   both indoor or outdoor play, tug of war is fun and engaging for your
   dog. Plus, all that pulling and tugging is a good source of physical
   exercise. Avoid overexciting your dog with this game, and don’t let
   children play this one.

   A few things to keep in mind: be careful if you’re playing tug of war
   with a puppy. Remember, puppies’ mouths have not fully formed, and they
   still have their baby teeth. Only pull gently for a few seconds at a
   time. If they seem too little, explore other play activities.

   Keep your dog’s tooth and gum health in mind when playing tug of war.
   Use something that won’t hurt the insides of their mouth. Try using a
   rope, or a dog toy made from soft rubber. If your dog has a history of
   back and neck injuries, try another activity until talking with your
   veterinarian.

3. Hide the Treat or Hide & Seek

   If you’re looking to play mentally stimulating mind games for dogs, you
   can’t go wrong with hide the treat. This dog enrichment game is a fun
   way for them to exercise their problem-solving skills. Simply leave a
   trail by rubbing the treat on a few spots along the way to its hiding
   space, then place it somewhere that’s challenging for your dog to find.

   As your dog searches, try using language like “hot” and “cold” as your
   dog gets closer and further away from the treat. Changing your tone
   from a calm “cold” to an excited “warm” or “hot” will build their
   listening skills, though it will take some training before they truly
   understand.

4. Chase the Prey

   Unleash your dog’s natural hunting instincts in a positive way that
   won’t result in local squirrels scampering up a tree. This game uses a
   flirt pole. A flirt pole is a long pole or stick with a rope attached
   to one end. You can either purchase a flirt pole or make one with a
   little bit of DIY.

   Tie a toy to the rope of the flirt pole and drag it slowly,
   occasionally stopping as your dog gets ready to pounce. Make sure to
   let your dog “catch” the toy periodically as a reward, so they gain
   confidence and don’t lose interest.

5. Agility Training

   If you’re ready to take it to the next level, agility training is the
   way to go. Agility training is the ultimate mental and physical
   stimulation for dogs. It will help your dog burn off excess energy and
   help tire them out for a long nap or a restful night of sleep.

   Set up an obstacle course in a yard or park with objects from around
   the house. You can use boxes to jump over, cones for them to weave
   between and anything else that comes to mind. If you have a hula hoop,
   teach them to jump through it and, of course, reward them with treats
   as they make progress.

Avoid Overstimulation

   There are lots of games to play with dogs both inside and outside.
   Having fun with your dog enriches both of your lives but avoid play
   that’s too aggressive or leads to overstimulation.

   Make sure to end your play sessions while you’re both having a good
   time. This leaves your dog excited for their next play session rather
   than exhausted and discouraged.
