   Advertising in video games is the integration of advertising into video
   games to promote products, organizations, or viewpoints.^[1]

   There are two major categories of advertising in video games: in-game
   advertising and advergames.^[2] In-game advertising shows the player
   advertisements while playing the game,^[3] whereas advergames are a
   type of game created to serve as an advertisement for a brand or
   product.^[4]

   Other methods of advertising in video games include in-game product
   placement and sponsorship of commercial games or other game-related
   content.^[5]

Categories[edit]

In-game advertising[edit]

   Main article: In-game advertising
   [220px-FIFA_International_Soccer.gif] An Adidas billboard is displayed
   in the foreground of the 1994 video game FIFA International Soccer
   (also, the electronic board that appears with every goal scored
   sometimes reads "Panasonic").

   In-game advertising is similar to product placement in films and
   television, where the advertising content exists within the universe of
   the characters. These forms of product placement are common, which led
   to the advertisement technique being applied to video games to match
   evolving media consumption habits.^[6]^[7] According to the
   Entertainment Software Association in 2010, 42% of gamers said they
   play online games one or more hours per week.^[8] Game playing is
   considered active media consumption, which provides a unique
   opportunity for advertisers. The principal advantages of product
   placement in gaming are visibility and notoriety. A single in-game
   advertisement may be encountered by the player multiple times, and
   advertisers have an opportunity to ally a brand's image with that of a
   well-received game.

   Billboards, storefronts, posters, apparel, vehicles, weapons, fliers,
   sponsored product placement, and the interplay between the player and
   these elements in the game allow for a great degree of virtual
   advertisement.^[9] Examples of marketing in video games include brand
   integration, embedded marketing, recruitment tools, edutainment, and
   traditional in-game advertising.

   According to Forbes, in-game advertising is expected to reach $7.2
   billion in 2016.^[10] Unlike television commercials and digital ads,
   which can be avoided by using DVRs and ad-blocking software,
   advertisements embedded within video games cannot be bypassed. A more
   recent example of in-game advertising is Google's placement of video
   ads between levels of games. These ads are usually branded inline, and
   TechCrunch reports that they have the potential to gain fast traction
   in Google's AdMob Service.^[11]

Static in-game advertising[edit]

   Static in-game advertisements are embedded into the video game
   program.^[9] Static ads can be used in the story-line of the game and
   players can interact with them.^[9] The creation of the ads can take
   from a month or years to reach the public.^[9] These ads do not require
   players to have access to an Internet connection in order to display
   the campaigns.^[9] Limitations include ads becoming outdated or
   irrelevant as consumer habits change.^[9] Because these ads cannot
   change once released to the public, they also lack the ability to be
   customized based on player demographics.^[9] Examples include
   billboards advertising for (and product placement of) Bawls energy
   drink in Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, and billboards for Adidas
   sportswear in FIFA International Soccer.

Dynamic in-game advertising[edit]

   Dynamic in-game advertisements are embedded in online video games that
   can be changed at any time by the game programmers.^[9]^[6] Examples of
   this type of advertisement would be virtual billboards and updates that
   introduce new items into the game like clothing brands to dress
   characters or different cars.^[6] Dynamics ads are different from
   static games because companies can provide ads for specific audiences
   or demographics after the video game has been purchased by the
   consumer.^[6] This way companies can follow the consumer habits and
   provide ads that can address a certain context.^[6] Game developers
   then can dynamically change the virtual ads spaces embedded into the
   game to display the ads.^[7] Players have a limited interaction with
   these ads compared to static in-game ads.^[9] These ads required active
   Internet connection for the game company to showcase the ads.^[9]
   Dynamic ads can accommodate time sensitive campaigns and can be shown
   immediately.^[9] These ads can also provide data to show how well
   campaigns are doing unlike static in-game ads.^[9]

Advergames[edit]

   Main article: Advergame

   Video games that are expressly commissioned to promote a product or
   service are referred to as "advergames", a portmanteau of "advertising"
   and "gaming". This term was coined in January 2000 by Anthony
   Giallourakis and later mentioned by Wired's "Jargon Watch" column in
   2001.^[12] Advergames have been developed for different platforms
   including company websites, gaming consoles, and more recently, mobile
   applications and social media platforms.^[13] With the growth of the
   Internet, advergames have proliferated, often becoming the most visited
   aspect of brand websites and becoming an integrated part of brand media
   planning. The advergames sector reached $207 million in 2007.^[14]

   The earliest custom video games featuring integrated brand messages
   were developed and distributed on floppy disk.^[15] These games were
   distributed for free, often bundled with other products from the
   company advertised for. The first floppy disk advergames were developed
   to serve dual purposes--as promotional incentives that drive response
   and as media that deliver awareness. American Home Foods Chef Boyardee
   issued one of the earliest floppy-disk advergames.^[16] Some brands,
   like Kool-Aid and Pepsi, created early advergames on gaming platforms.
   They created advergames for the Atari 2600 and gave out promotional
   copies.^[15] The first in-box CD-ROM cereal box advergames are General
   Mills's Chex Quest (promoting the Chex brand) and General Mills's
   All-Star baseball (starring Trix Rabbit and his friends playing
   baseball against Major League teams and stars).

   Commercial examples include advergames funded by Pepsi, 7 Up, NFL,
   Formula One, and Burger King. Political and military examples of
   below-the-line (BTL) advergames include recruitment tools like
   America's Army, intended to boost recruitment for the United States
   Army, and Special Force, intended to promote Muslim resistance to the
   state of Israel. Educational advergaming is closely related to the
   Serious games initiative and falls under either Edumarket gaming or
   edutainment. Examples include Food Force (made by the United Nations's
   World Food Program) and Urban Jungle, an educational traffic
   simulation.

  Through-the-line advertising[edit]

   [220px-ILoveBees_-_Homepage.png] I Love Bees makes use of
   "link-chasing" and is designed to foster viral marketing.

   Examples of through-the-line (TTL) advertising in games include
   "link-chases," ARGs, and viral marketing.

   TTL marketing is a form of advertising in video games that involve the
   use of URL hyperlinks within the game designed to induce the player to
   visit a web page which then contains BTL advertisements. The technique
   used to tempt the player into visiting the intended URL varies from
   game to game.^[17] In games like Pikmin 2, the player is given a
   cryptic message with an accompanying URL designed to pique their
   curiosity. In games such as Enter the Matrix, Year Zero, I Love Bees,
   and Lost Experience, URLs make up a part of the background of the game
   such that certain plot details can only be learned by following the
   link. The knowledge of such plot details are typically not required to
   complete the game, but deepen the game story-line for players who
   follow the links. Websites of this nature often lead players on to
   other links which again lead to further links, thus earning these games
   the label "link-chases". Although TTL advertising can be an enjoyable
   experience for players, excessive "link-chasing" can feel obstructive
   and discourage them from diving deeper into a game's story-line. In
   another form, the URL might be part of a stage where a player can see
   it but it does not affect the plot. For example, in Super Monkey Ball
   2, there is a stage where players can see clearly written on an
   obstacle a URL and the stage's name is even the word URL.

Industry impact[edit]

  Prevalence and efficacy[edit]

   In 2019, a survey conducted by deltaDNA found that 94% of free-to-play
   video game developers incorporate some form of in-game
   advertising.^[18] Among those, the most common type of advertisement
   were rewarded videos, which are videos that players can watch to earn
   in-game prizes.^[18] Rewarded videos are shown to be more effective
   than forced advertising; players are 23% more likely to buy products
   and 18% more likely to make in-app purchases when shown rewarded videos
   instead of forced advertising.^[19]

   The reaction to in-game advertising has been overall positive, with 73%
   of players being happy with ad-funded games.^[19]

   The effectiveness of advertising in video games is debated by
   scholars.^[3]^[20]^[21] Brand name recognition in sports game has been
   shown to be low among college students, although players did retain
   fragments of the brand names.^[3] Another study found that 35% of
   players could recall advertised brands in car racing games.^[20]
   Interactive in-game advertisements, such as brand products that are
   used in game, are shown to produce greater brand awareness and more
   positive brand attitudes than passively added advertisements, such as
   posters or billboards.^[21]

  Mobile[edit]

   Mobile in-game advertisements are advertisements within mobile games
   that lead the user to the website or installation page of the
   advertised product or software upon being clicked.^[22] Mobile gaming
   advertisements can take different forms, including banner ads, pop-up
   ads, video ads, and interactive ads. Banner ads will display on
   portions of the screen while the user continues to interact with the
   mobile game.^[23] Pop-up ads will display the advertisement on the
   entire mobile screen, typically disrupting gameplay; they appear
   between loading screens or when in-game milestones are completed, only
   allowing users to close the pop-up ad once a timer runs out.^[24] Video
   ads will display a video advertisement of the advertised products on
   the entire mobile screen.^[25] Interactive ads are a form of pop-up ad
   that allows the user to interact with the advertisement.^[26] For
   instance, Candy Crush Saga, a free-to-play mobile game, uses playable
   ads to advertise their game on other mobile applications and provide
   potential customers with a demo of their game.^[27] In 2019, mobile
   advertising contributed $39.9 billion in revenue to the mobile gaming
   industry.^[28]

  ESRB[edit]

   The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) assigns ratings based on
   a detailed questionnaire about the game's content and a gameplay clip
   provided by the publisher.^[29] Possible rating categories are
   "Everyone", "Everyone 10+", "Teen", "Mature 17+", and "Adults Only
   18+".^[30] Ratings are supplemented with content descriptions, such as
   "Blood", "Partial Nudity", and "Use of Alcohol".^[30] All updates and
   downloadable content (DLC), including both static and dynamic in-game
   advertising, are expected to be compliant with the game's rating and
   descriptors, though DLC can be submitted for its own, independent
   rating if necessary.^[31]

   If any post-release content is determined to be incompatible with the
   rating of the base game, publishers are required to update all physical
   and digital displays of the rating.^[29] In the case of physical games,
   where it is difficult to make these modifications once a game has
   shipped, sanctions and fines may be levied on the publisher.^[29]

   The ESRB also includes an Advertising Review Council (ARC) that
   oversees the marketing of video games in the United States and
   Canada.^[32] Cross-promotion, including when a video game is promoted
   within another, falls under this umbrella.^[32] The ARC ensures that
   the game being advertised is accurately represented and is not being
   marketed toward parties below the suitable age range.^[32]

Legislative developments[edit]

  Academic research[edit]

   The University of Bath's Institute for Policy Research researched the
   use of advergames in marketing to children in the United Kingdom.^[33]
   The report, published in June 2014, suggested that children as old as
   15 did not recognize that advergames were adverts and had their food
   choices influenced without their conscious awareness.^[34] Based on
   these findings, the University called for "urgent government action to
   protect children from the subconscious effects of advergames."^[33]

  United States legislation[edit]

    Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998[edit]

   The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) directs
   the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to protect the personal data
   collected from children online.^[35] Operators of websites or online
   services are barred from handling the personal information of children
   under the age of 13 without verifiable consent from a parent or
   guardian.^[36] Restrictions apply to any website or online service that
   is targeted toward children or has knowledge that it is collecting data
   from children.^[36]

    Do Not Track Kids Acts[edit]

   Representatives Edward Markey [D-MA] and Joe Barton [R-TX] proposed the
   Do Not Track Kids Act of 2011 as an amendment to COPPA.^[37] The bill
   would have extended COPPA to prohibit companies from distributing
   personal and geolocation information knowingly collected from minors
   for use in targeted advertising.^[37] It also expands the restrictions
   enumerated in the act to both online and mobile applications, which had
   previously been omitted.^[37]

   Regarding his motivation for co-sponsoring the Act, Representative
   Barton reflected, "We have reached a troubling point in the state of
   the business when companies that conduct business online are so eager
   to make a buck, they resort to targeting our children."^[38]

   Since the death of the 2011 bill, Markey and Barton have continued to
   spawn similar Do Not Track Kids legislation in both chambers of
   Congress.^[39]^[40]^[41]^[42]^[43]^[44] These bills were proposed in
   2013, 2015, and 2018, though none of them passed through the committee
   stage.^[39]^[40]^[41]^[42]^[43]^[44]

    Targeted advergame marketing[edit]

   A bill was recently introduced in the Senate that proposes restrictions
   on the use of information obtained through advergames to market to
   children. Some games ask users to provide personal information, such as
   name, gender, and age, then display targeted advertisements based on
   these characteristics. This bill would prevent companies from using
   this information to change the game to target certain age brackets.

Examples[edit]

  Food and beverages[edit]

     * Mattel's M Network division released the "promogame" Kool-Aid Man
       for the Atari 2600 and Intellivision in 1983. The game was

       from Kool-Aid containers, but later became available for retail
       purchase.^[45]^[46]
     * Purina had a mail-in offer for the Atari 2600 game Chase the Chuck
       Wagon for customers of Chuck Wagon dog food in 1983.^[46]

       their stamina meter.^[52]

  Movies and entertainment[edit]

     * Cineplex Entertainment features an advergame open to the public,
       known as Top Popper during non-contest periods and Peel and Pop
       during contest periods. In the cinemas, there is a TimePlay
       advergame that plays before the show.^[citation needed]
     * Fortnite and Marvel Entertainment teamed up in 2018 to promote
       Avengers: Infinity War by bringing Thanos, the film's antagonist,

       one player at a time to become Thanos, giving them several new
       abilities and a regenerating shield.^[53]

  Cross-franchise promotion[edit]
