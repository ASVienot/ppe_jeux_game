Overview
                                     Video games have been a popular form
                                     of entertainment and leisure for
                                     decades and are now the largest
                                     grossing entertainment industry in
                                     the world. At the same time, games
                                     are thought to impact a broad range
                                     of human functioning, from subjective
                                     well-being to cognition.
                                     Specifically, some studies have
                                     associated video game play with
                                     increased performance in attention
                                     control, working memory, executive
                                     functioning, and other cognitive
                                     abilities.
                                     Because these cognitive abilities
                                     that games purportedly affect may
                                     contribute to human functioning more
                                     broadly, such as educational and
                                     career achievement, it is important
                                     that studies are conducted using the
                                     most rigorous and valid methods
                                     available, and that multiple
                                     approaches to the question are
                                     employed. However, the research
                                     record on this topic thus far has had
                                     a blind spot on large,
                                     representative, and ecologically
                                     valid studies.
                                     This project aims to study the
                                     association between video game play
                                     and cognition using novel
                                     ecologically valid methods that
                                     improve upon the existing literature
                                     by studying gaming in its natural
                                     context, using actual game play data.
                                     We intend to recruit a large
                                     representative sample of gamers from
                                     industry partners’ online platforms,
                                     who would contribute their actual
                                     gameplay data—when, how and what they
                                     play. Volunteers would then complete
                                     online cognitive tasks that measure
                                     their attention control, working
                                     memory, and executive functioning, as
                                     well provide their motivations for
                                     playing. We will then be in a unique
                                     position to examine the naturally
                                     occurring associations between gaming
                                     behaviours and performance on those
                                     cognitive domains.
                                     The main proposed scientific merit of
                                     this study is a robust and
                                     transparent investigation, and a
                                     subsequent open-access publication
