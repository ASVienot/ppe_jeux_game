   child must make it around the circle to the sitting place of the
   `goose' child, while the `goose' child must attempt to tag the `it'
   child before he/she makes it to where the `goose' was sitting.

Example

   around tapping everyone on the head, saying `Duck' for each person she
   taps. Then she taps Linda on the head and says `Goose'. Linda gets up
   to chase Isabelle as Isabelle runs around the circle and tries to get

   drawing. The artist cannot talk or write words or letters.

   still has the hat on loses!

Example

   Taylor is the hat woman. During the night, Uncle Jimmy is in the middle

   notice. He loses.

   at that time is the out!

Example

   All children are sitting in a circle, except for Susie. She is standing

Example

   Gregory and Allison are at separate ends of the table. The ping pong
   ball is placed in the middle and the judge signals to start blowing.
   Allison blows so hard that the ball falls off of the table on Gregory's
   side. Allison Wins!

Let Them Eat Cake

Description

   Set slices of cake on plates around the table in front of each child.

   finish the entire piece before everyone else, so he wins.
   (BUTTON)

Example

   Julissa is trying to walk under the pole. She leans backwards so that
   she can make it under. Unfortunately she hits the pole with her

   does so without touching it or falling so she gets to move onto the
   next round.

Mummy Wrap

Description

   Divide children into two teams and assign each team a `mummy'. Give
   each team one roll of toilet paper. When the game starts, the kids must

   toilet paper first is the winner.

Example

   Vince is chosen to be the mummy. His team hurries to wrap him up in
   toilet paper. They finish their roll before the other team, therefore
   they are the winners!

Musical Chairs

Description

   Set up chairs so that there is one less chair than there are number of
   players. Children are instructed to walk in a circle around the chairs
   as music plays. When the music stops, the children must sit in a seat.
   Whoever is without a seat is out. Each round you take away a chair
   until there is only one player left!

Example

   Four kids are walking around a group of three chairs. When the music
   stops, Jim tries to get to a chair but Timmy, Alice, and Trevor sit in
   seats before he can get to one. Jim is out. The game continues until
   there is only one person left sitting.
   (BUTTON)

Novel

Description

   Assign one person to start the game. He/she writes a sentence that
   starts a story then passes the pen and paper to the next person in
   line. They add a sentence, continuing the story. This continues until
   the last person gets to write a sentence to finish the story. Then you
   read the mashup story aloud.

Example

   Derek starts the story by writing, `A man is walking down the
   street...', then Leslie goes next and writes, `and then he trips and
   falls.' Then Samuel takes the paper and continues the story to say,
   `when he gets up he realizes he has lost his glasses...' They continue

   children seeing. Try everyday objects like candy, fruit, toothpicks, or

   impersonating) and tries to figures out the pattern.

Example

   Greg leaves the room. Everyone else in the room decides that they will
   impersonate the person to their left. Greg comes back and asks the
   first person what color hair they have, or what their age is. This
   helps Greg figure out the pattern and win the game.

   during RED LIGHT must go back to start. Whoever crosses the finish line
   wins.

Example

   One person hides items in a designated area. Then they write clues as
   to where each item is. The players break into teams and try to find all
   of the items on the list in a given time limit. Whichever team finds
   the most wins!

Example

   John's team has a clue that says `This item is kept with the apples'.
   So, they check to see if the item is the apple tree in the yard.
   However, Jane's team chooses to look in the refrigerator where the
   apples are kept cold. Jane's team finds the item!

Tug of War

Description

   Place a flag or marker in the middle of a thick rope. Then break up
   children into two equal teams and have them stand behind lines
   equidistant from the middle of the rope. When the game starts, each
   side pulls on the rope to try to get the flag over their line.

Example

   Judy's team stands on one side of the rope, with Tyler's team on the
   other. Both teams pull extremely hard, but since Tyler's side is
   stronger, they end up pulling the rope over their winning line.
   (BUTTON)

Twenty Questions

Description

   One person thinks of an object or person. Then players are only allowed
   to ask 20 Yes or No questions to try to guess what it is. If they
   correctly guess the object, the next person goes.

Example

   John is thinking of actor Harrison Ford. The players ask questions
   like, `Is this a person?', `Is this a famous person?', `Is it a male?'.
   Finally, the players narrow it down enough so that Susan guesses, `Is
   he Harrison Ford.' Susan wins!
   (BUTTON)

Two Truths and a Lie

Description

   Each player tells three statements about themselves, except only two
   are truths and one is made up. The other players go around the room
   guessing which they think the lie is.

Example

   Frank says that he is 25, was captain of his baseball team, and once
   caught a 25 lb fish. All of the other players guessed that his age was
   the lie. They were right! He was only 22.

Whisper Down the Lane

Description

   Everybody arranges in a circle. One player starts the game by
   whispering a phrase in the ear of the person on his/her left. This gets
   repeated all the way around the circle until it reaches the start.

Example

   Mitzi whispers, `I took a drink from the fountain' into the ear of
   Taylor. Then Taylor whispers what she thought she heard into the ear of
   the person next to her. By the end of the line, they realize that at
   some point something was miscommunicated, because the last person says
   `I snuck a drink from a falcon'.
   (BUTTON)

Who Am I

Description

   Each player writes a name of a famous person on a card. The card is
   then given facedown to the person to their left. Then the cards are
   taped (or held) to each player's forehead. Players take turns asking
   only yes or no questions to figure out the identity of the person on
   the card.

Example

   John has the name `President Obama' on his card. He asks, `Am I
   famous?', and the group answers, `Yes'. Next, Gwen, who has the name
   `Pocahontas' on her forehead, asks `Am I male?' and the group says,
   `No'. They keep asking questions until Gwen guesses the correct name on
   her card before John.
