Beyond Wordle: the best word games to try next

   Whether you are frustrated by the smash hit puzzle, or hungry for more,
   there are endless alternatives out there - but which are the best?

   The debate continues to rage among Wordle players: has the New York
   Times ruined it? Why are there suddenly so many double-letter days
   (SWILL, seriously?); so many frustrating solutions that hinge on a
   single, ambiguous letter? And what about “caulk”? Has something
   changed? Or are people just losing interest? Since Wordle caught the
   world’s attention, there has been a fast-flowing stream of copycats and
   humorous takes on the word-guessing game, based on everything from
   swearing (Sweardle) to choral music (Byrdle) to geography (Worldle). If
   you’re looking for something different, though, rather than just an
   inventive twist on the same theme, the Android and Apple app stores
   have many other word games you can play on your phone. Fans have been
   quietly enjoying some of these for years – some offer a daily five or
   10 minutes of puzzle fun, while others let you sink as much time into
   them as you want.
   SpellTower

SpellTower

   SpellTower is an inspired combination of Boggle and Tetris, in which
   players make words out of adjacent letter tiles in order to clear the
   play space. In the puzzle mode, subsequent layers of letters are
   continually added until the pile reaches the top of the screen and the
   game ends. It’s a unique and compelling test of both your vocabulary
   and your spatial planning skills, and like Wordle it gets you to see
   words as tactical objects as well as units of language.
   Wurdweb

Wurdweb

   This is a really fascinating take on Scrabble, which gives you a
   selection of words and then challenges you to place them on the board
   without running out of playable spaces. It sounds easy, but if you add
   too many words in one corner you can soon come adrift, and you have to
   make careful use of the premium squares. Scrabble fans will enjoy the
   way the game explores word placement strategies, and success unlocks
   the more demanding “precise mode”, which requires players to finish on
   a specific square. Not for the faint-hearted.
   Baba Is You
   Baba Is You

Baba Is You

   As much a logic game as a word game, this endearingly lo-fi puzzler has
   you shifting words around to change the rules. Unshiftable boulders can
   be pushed aside if you create the sentence ROCK IS MOVE; if there’s a
   key hidden down a maze, try KEY IS YOU and you can possess it and move
   it somewhere more accessible. It will outsmart you, but it will also
   make you feel like a genius when you crack it.
   Letter Quest: Grimm’s Journey
   Letter Quest: Grimm’s Journey

Letter Quest: Grimm’s Journey

   A kind of slightly violent Scrabble, in Letter Quest, you guide a cute
   little grim reaper through dungeons full of monsters, defeating them by
   conjuring impressive words from a panel of letter tiles. Any word will
   do damage, but the fun comes from figuring out particularly appropriate
   or long ones; there’s nothing quite as satisfying as defeating a
   werewolf with “silver”. It’s a lovely combination of word puzzles and
   old-school dungeon-delving adventure. Anyone who played the fondly
   remembered Bookworm Adventures, sadly now scrubbed from existence, will
   especially enjoy this.
   Love Wordle? Here are three reasons why you’ll love cryptic crosswords

Kitty Letter

   In this gently bizarre, free game, you unscramble words from a
   hexagonal grid of letters to send little armies of exploding cats
   towards your opponent’s house. It’s quite frantic, rather than
   contemplative, and more fun against a friend (or a stranger) online,
   but there’s a single-player mode too, featuring surreal interactive
   comics.
   Typeshift
   Typeshift

Typeshift

   This is not unlike Wordle – there’s a word that the game wants you to
   guess, and you have to puzzle it out – but this gives you a slot
   machine wheel of different letters, and you spin each column around
   with your finger until something makes sense. It also has a mode where
   you have to figure out several words from crossword-style clues,
   working with what you’re given. There’s something very satisfying about
   the tactile nature of Typeshift, like playing with a padlock
   combination made of letters.
   Alphabear: Words Across Time
   Alphabear: Words Across Time

Alphabear: Words Across Time

   This is much cuter and weirder than anything you’ll find in a newspaper
   puzzle app – it features little collectible square-headed bears, and
   making longer, better words out of the letter grid in front of you
   creates more, bigger bears. It pairs word-building with the human
   appetite for collecting things. The words you’ve spelled then get made
   into absurd cartoons after every round. It’s very funny and adorable,
   and appealing enough to draw kids into some spelling-related fun.
