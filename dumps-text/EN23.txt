   Research has shown that there are many benefits to playing games in the
   classroom. When planning lessons, teachers should try to incorporate at
   least one game a day into one of the key learning areas as either a
   teaching and learning tool, assessment strategy or classroom motivator.

     “Play is our brain’s favourite way of learning” – Diane Ackeman

   When playing games, students become more engaged in their learning,
   taught content is reinforced and class positivity is increased.

   In this blog we have outlined ten of the most important benefits
   students gain from playing games in the classroom. We have also
   selected some of our most popular Numeracy, Literacy, Technology,
   History and Fitness games for you to download and use in your own
   classroom.

10 Benefits to Playing Games in the Classroom

More Motivation

   Playing games in the classroom increases overall motivation. By playing
   games, students become more motivated to learn, pay attention and
   participate in set tasks. Games help students to become a part of a
   team as well as take responsibility for their own learning. They can
   also be a great classroom management tool, helping to motivate a class.

   They can also be a great classroom management tool, helping to motivate
   a class.

Controlled Competitiveness

   Students can become very competitive in the classroom, especially boys.
   Games are a great way to control the competitiveness between peers.

   By using games in the classroom, students can compete against each
   other whilst playing a game, then support each other during other
   learning activities.

Strategy Simulator

   Most games require problem-solving strategies and planning. By applying
   a range of strategies in a game, students are able to use their working
   memory to solve problems, increasing their mental cognition.
   Stimulating the brain with strategies in a game can be a great brain
   workout!

Peer Positivity

   Using games in a lesson as part of teaching and learning helps to
   create positivity around the lesson, motivating students with their
   participation and creating a positive attitude towards learning.

   Games can also create a positive memory and experience of learning for
   students in the classroom.

Smaller Stress

   Having to answer questions on a worksheet or produce a page of text can
   be quite daunting and stressful for some students. It can also create a
   negative perception of a students’ learning environment.

   As an alternative to worksheets, games can be used as a less stressful
   way for students to demonstrate their knowledge, skill and
   understanding of a topic. Being less stressed will help students to
   have a more positive perception of their learning environment and give
   a true indication of their own learning.

Mighty Memory

   Playing a range of content-specific games can increase memory! As they
   play a game, students need to remember important details about a topic
   but also use their working memory to think and act quickly.

   Games that were made by the students can be some of the most effective.
   As students construct a game they are required to use their memory of
   specific content to create questions and answers suitable for the game,
   then use their memory of the topic to play the game.

Class Cooperation

   Playing games in the classroom increases class cooperation. Classroom
   games can also be used as a team-building exercise!

   Students need to work together as a team when playing as a whole class
   against the teacher, or in small team groups when playing games with
   each other.

   In this way, students learn how to take turns, build respect, listen to
   others and play fairly.

Alert Attention

   Playing games requires students to pay great attention to detail. As
   games can move quickly, when playing a game a student needs to be alert
   and attentive.

   This attentiveness when playing a game can help students to stay
   focused on other tasks in the classroom throughout the day.

Friendly Fun

   Playing games in the classroom is always great fun!

   When playing a game, endorphins are produced that stimulate the brain
   and gives students a feeling of euphoria. This feeling of euphoria
   creates a great sense of happiness and excitement for students in the
   classroom, developing a positive learning environment.

New Knowledge

   Games are a great tool to use in the classroom to consolidate new
   knowledge.

   After teaching new content to the class, provide students with a game
   that will consolidate their understanding and make connections with
   what they already know. Asking students to create their own
   content-specific games can also be a great way to assess students at
   the end of a unit of work.

Take it Outside

   Games aren’t just for inside the classroom. Going outside and enjoying
   the outdoors can also provide a bit of brain break for your students,
   all while consolidating a topic they are learning about!

   Here’s a great example… all you need are some hula hoops, bean bags and
   some enthusiastic kids!
