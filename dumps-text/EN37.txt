A Brief History of Games

   Human history and games are inextricably intertwined. Irrefutable
   evidence resounds down through the ages that fun and games are not
   frivolous pursuits per se—instead, they come naturally to us as
   essential parts of being alive. When you understand the evolution of
   games, you can begin to make intelligent choices about what elements of
   games you might want to include in your gamification designs.

A Dim and Distant Past

   Have you ever been to the zoo? If so, you’ll most likely have sat and
   watched monkeys and apes for a while. It doesn’t take very much to see
   them at play. They’ll chase each other, throw things, jump on each
   other, and that kind of thing. Assuming, as seems likely, that human
   beings are just better evolved monkeys, it’s likely that we’ve been
   playing games for a long, long time. We were probably playing games
   before we learned to speak or even to stand on two legs.

   That means we have no idea what the first games we played were like.
   However, we do have a good idea of the timeline of modern game
   development.

Rolling the Dice 3,000 Years Ago

   Dice aren’t a modern invention. In fact, they’re probably among the
   oldest known gaming tools known to man. During an excavation in
   Southeastern Iran, archeologists discovered a 3,000-year-old set of
   dice! We don’t know exactly what games those early Persians would have
   played with them, but the popularity of dice has endured throughout the
   centuries.

   Dice games have been with mankind for a very long time, as you can see
   from this cave painting.

   In 14th-century England, people were playing a game called Hazard (it’s
   mentioned in that famous work The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey
   Chaucer), and Hazard didn’t fall out of favour until the 19th century.
   It had a very complex rule set and has since been supplanted by dice
   games with simpler rules.

     “Take a simple idea and take it seriously.”
     —Charlie Munger, American investor, businessman, lawyer and
     philanthropist

   Whether carved in bone or cast in plastic, the simplicity of a die—a
   cube with dots and nothing more—as an effective, if chancy, determinant
   is ageless. You may not know this, but the most popular game in casinos
   would remain—well into the 21st century—a dice game. Craps is the only
   game in a gambling house where the odds are in favour of the gambler.
   Despite this, it’s the most profitable game for the casinos; people
   don’t seem to know just when to stop playing. And play they
   do—elsewhere, too, using dice in a range of fun-filled activities that
   have been extending into less adult settings, such as homes and
   schools, through the years. Yahtzee revolves around dice, and not for
   nothing does Dungeons & Dragons incorporate dice, even if many of those
   dice have 4, 10, 12, 20 or even more faces.

Tiles and Dominoes

   There are references to tile games in China that are over 2,900 years
   old. Dominoes emerged 1,000 years later during the Song Dynasty (also
   in China). However, Western dominoes probably only began in the 18th
   century, and Mahjong (the most popular tile game in the world – it’s of
   Chinese origin) didn’t arrive until the 19th century.

Board Games are Even Older

   If you enjoy a game of Monopoly or Scrabble, it would appear that you
   are in good company. The earliest known board games are 5,000 years old
   and were played by the Egyptians. We don’t know the rules of these
   games, but there is a “Senet” board that dates back to about 3500 B.C.!

   The Chinese invented their first known board game in 200 B.C., and, in
   Western Europe, they were playing Tafl (a game very similar to chess)
   from 400 B.C.

   Chess is often considered to be the “archetypal” board game and is
   itself very old, but there were board games well prior to the invention
   of chess.

Still Playing!

   If you’ve ever played Go, Chess, Backgammon or Nine Men’s Morris, then
   you’ve played a game with more than a thousand years of history! Go is
   from 200 B.C. in Korea, Backgammon from Iran around 600 A.D. (complete
   with dice), Chess from India around the same time and Nine Men’s Morris
   may be from Mediaeval England, but many think it stems from the Roman
   Empire!

   Snakes and Ladders, one of the world’s most popular children’s games
   probably began in India in the 16th century. And, surprise, surprise,
   dice power the probability for players in that game, too.

   The first commercial board game arrived in the year 1800 and was
   produced by George Fox in England. It was called the Mansion of
   Happiness and was essentially a “race game” similar to Ludo. The oldest
   surviving board game company is Milton Bradley (whose famous games
   include; Downfall, Hungry Hippos and Connect 4), who were formed in
   1860!

   The Mansion of Happiness was the very first board game to be produced
   commercially (i.e., on an industrial basis).

Deal Me In!

   Card games are a more recent invention, and the first use of a card
   deck was probably in Ancient China. They would have been played during
   the Tang Dynasty (6th century A.D. – 9th century A.D.). Cards reached
   Europe in the 14th century, and early decks would have been very
   similar to Tarot cards, whose modern and classic mediaeval versions we
   can find online or in virtually any bookstore’s Mind, Body and Spirit
   section.

   The four-suit (hearts, spades, clubs and diamonds) deck that we’re most
   familiar with was invented in France around 1480. The oldest card game
   that we still play is probably Cribbage, which came from the 17th
   century. Bridge didn’t arrive until the early 19th century.

   In the 1990s, cards were revisited and games like ‘Magic! The
   Gathering’ were introduced and became incredibly popular. Card games
   would also extend to trumps—a classic favourite in British schools,
   featuring items from racing cars to spacecraft, Western gunfighters and
   horror monsters, in which players compare the statistics of their
   topmost cards, and win or lose accordingly.

Table Games

   Carom, is possibly the oldest table game (it’s very similar to
   tiddlywinks or shuffleboard), but no-one knows exactly when or where it
   came into existence. Pool, billiards and snooker are all relatively
   recent inventions, and roulette only arrived in the 19th century.

   The game pictured above, may look (at first glance) like pool, but it’s
   actually a modern billiards table—as you can see by the lack of pockets
   on the table.

You’re in Good Company

   As you can see, games have a long rich history, and whenever you decide
   to play a game, you’re in good company. Human beings have been playing
   games throughout the centuries. They are part of the human experience.

What about Electronic Games?

   You may be surprised to find that the first electronic game was
   invented in the United States before the computer! A patent was filed
   back in 1947 for a “Cathode ray tube amusement device”. In the 1950s,
   also in the United States, (very few) people began playing computer
   games on mainframe systems – these would have been out of reach for the
   vast majority of people as the hardware would have been astronomically
   expensive.

   The first games console was the Magnavox Odyssey – released in 1972.
   Arcade games such as Space Invaders, Pacman, etc. began life in 1978
   and became hugely popular into the early 1980s. During that time, quite
   a few consoles were released, but a crash in the American gaming
   industry killed off most of the companies involved in 1983. When the
   Japanese picked up the reins and began developing video games, console
   gaming became universally popular, signalling the slow downfall of the
   arcade game.

     “Everyone has played video games at some point these days, and video
     games are fun.”
     —PewDiePie, Swedish comedian and web producer

   Games have a long history, as you can see, and the electronic game’s
   roots stretch right back to the earliest of human games. It’s not that
   our ancestors needed to tell us that games go with the territory of
   being alive; games are hardwired into our DNA.

The Take Away

   Human history and games are inextricably intertwined. For millennia,
   people have held an innate compulsion to play, and that won’t change
   anytime soon. What they needed, they innovated, leaving us a wealthy
   legacy of devices through the centuries, ranging from the basic but
   powerful wonder of dice, to the timeless strategising involved in
   chess, and on up to a library of latter-day board games that run the
   gamut in their levels of sophistication. As long as you’ve got an
   understanding the evolution of games, you can begin to make intelligent
   choices about what elements of games you might want to include in your
   gamification designs.
