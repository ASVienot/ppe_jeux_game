Archery Hunting for Small Game

   Archery Hunting for Small Game
   Steven Rinella
   Steven Rinella May 14, 2018

   Unlike big game hunting, where there are typically separate seasons for
   firearms and archery equipment, there are no legal incentives to hunt
   small game with a bow. There are a few exceptions to this rule,
   including an archery-only duck hunt on a coastal refuge in the vicinity
   of Anchorage, Alaska. That alone should make you interested in archery
   equipment.

   Instead, the decision to hunt small game with a bow typically comes
   down to personal aesthetics. Some hunters value a challenge as much or
   more as they value wild meat, and the thrill of hitting, or trying to
   hit, a flying bird or running rabbit with an arrow is too much to
   resist. My own father was such a guy. Over the years, he managed to
   kill many cottontails, squirrels, and grouse with his bow, as well as
   pheasants and ducks hit it in midair flight.

   Bow Hunting Philosophy
   My personal philosophy on bow selection is identical to my philosophy
   on rifles and shotguns. That is, I’m looking for a versatile hunting
   tool that can handle a wide variety of species under ever-shifting sets
   of circumstances be it calling javelina in the desert, perched high in
   a Midwest oak tree for whitetail deer, or still-hunting a Northern
   spruce forest for snowshoe hares.

   Nothing will meet these all of these challenges as efficiently as a
   fast-shooting compound bow. What’s more, by using the same bow for both
   big game and small game hunting, you’ll be practicing for big game
   hunting while chasing small game, and vice-versa.

   Traditional vs Compound
   But if you’re considering a bow purchase strictly for small game, and
   more particularly for flushed rabbits and game birds, you should
   consider going with a traditional recurve or longbow that will allow
   you to take snapshots at the fast-moving game. A compound bow must be
   held at full draw to aim and fire; this takes time and prevents snap
   shooting. Here are some additional pros and cons to consider when
   purchasing a bow that you’ll use for small game hunting.
   Top: Compound bow. This is a Hoyt Carbon Spyder with Easton Full Metal
   Jacket Arrow and a Wasp Archery fixed blade broadhead. Bottom: A
   traditional bow. Shown here is a Hoyt Tiburon recurve with High Plains
   Hunter arrow and Judo small game point.

   Compound Bow
   Pros: More accurate than traditional bows at longer ranges; it’s far
   easier to gain a comfortable level of proficiency with a compound than
   it is with a traditional bow .

   Cons: The increased speed of the arrow causes greater damage to the
   arrow as it deflects off of the ground and rocks after a miss, which
   can be common with small, fast-moving targets;  compounds are heavier
   than a traditional bows, and they can become a burden on long hikes;
   compound bows have many moving parts and require more maintenance than
   traditional bows.

   Traditional Bow
   Pros: Light, easy to carry; because the arrow is traveling slower, it
   can absorb the impact from errant shots and be used again; shots can be
   fired very quickly.

   Cons: Difficult to master; limited efficacy at longer ranges.

   It’s been speculated by anthropologists that human language came as a
   result of our need to organize hunting activities. As hunters, we rely
   on a commonality of terms in order to share information, swap stories,
   and ask questions. When one of us says something, it’s helpful if the
   rest of us knows what they’re talking about. To that end, here’s a
   basic rundown of methods and strategies used by small game hunters:

   You made the shot, and the bird crumpled and fell toward the ground. If
   you’re lucky, recovery will be as simple as walking over there and
   picking it up. Often, though, things are much more tricky than that.
   Recovery can be hard, time-consuming work when hunting in brushy or
   swampy areas where downed small game can be hidden from sight. Here are
   some tips to help you recover more game and bring more meat to the
   table. If you connect on a shot...

   For whatever reason, it seems as though big game hunters are far more
   likely than small game hunters to hit the road and spend a few nights
   camping out in the field. That’s too bad, because road trips can be
   extremely productive for small game hunting, especially when you travel
   to areas that receive very little hunting pressure. At various points
   in our lives, my brothers and I have done annual road trips for
   cottontail rabbits, quail, ducks...
