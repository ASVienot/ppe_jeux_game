   Educational games / 5 Interactive Games about Culture

5 Interactive Games about Culture

   By Med Kharbach, PhD | Last Update: November 2, 2023

   Games about culture are the topic of our blog post today!

   Google Arts & Culture acts as an enlightening window to the cultural
   diversity that our world has to offer. This treasure trove of knowledge
   allows students to step out of the confines of their classrooms and
   immerse themselves in a globally-informed learning journey.

   In an earlier post here in Educators Technology, I delved into the
   myriad opportunities Google Arts & Culture presents to enrich cultural
   literacy among students. I highlighted 10 practical and engaging ways
   in which students can tap into this valuable resource. Today, I am
   eager to zero in on one specific, and arguably highly effective, method
   - the utilization of game-based learning.

   One remarkable feature of Google Arts & Culture is its dedicated games
   section, designed with the aim to make learning about art and culture
   an enjoyable, interactive experience. This section boasts five distinct
   games about culture, each serving as an innovative gateway to an
   educational adventure.

   These games serve as brilliant tools to pique curiosity, encourage
   exploration, and deepen understanding about various aspects of art and
   culture. Below, you'll find more details about these cultural games.
   But before that, let's first talk about the importance of introducing
   students to games about culture.

Importance of Games about Culture

   Games about culture play a critical role in enhancing students
   educational experience in several key ways:
    1. Engagement and Interest: Incorporating games into the learning
       process can significantly increase students' engagement levels. The
       interactive nature of games, with their scoring systems, rewards,
       and visual storytelling elements, can make learning about culture a
       fun and exciting experience, thereby stimulating greater interest
       in the subject matter.
    2. Deeper Understanding: Games often involve problem-solving
       activities that require a deep understanding of the rules, context,
       and the scenario being presented. This immersive learning can
       enable students to comprehend cultural contexts, practices, and
       history in a more nuanced and personal way.
    3. Practical Application: Games allow students to apply what they've
       learned in practical scenarios. For instance, students might use
       their knowledge of a specific culture to interact with its virtual
       representations in a game, thereby reinforcing their understanding.
    4. Empathy and Perspective-taking: Cultural games can help students
       step into the shoes of people from other cultures, broadening their
       perspectives and enhancing their empathy. This can foster greater
       cultural sensitivity and respect for diversity.
    5. Memory Retention: The active participation required in games can
       help improve memory retention. Information learned in the course of
       gameplay is often better remembered than information delivered in
       more traditional, passive forms of learning.
    6. Cross-Cultural Communication Skills: Many cultural games encourage
       communication and collaboration among players. This can enhance
       students' ability to communicate effectively with people from
       diverse cultural backgrounds, a skill that is increasingly
       important in our globally connected world.

   Indeed, games about culture provide a valuable tool for students to
   engage with and understand the rich diversity of world cultures. They
   are not just fun to play, but also foster critical skills and values
   such as empathy, critical thinking, communication, and a respect for
   diversity.

Best Games about culture from Google Arts & Culture

   Here is a list of the best games about culture from Google Arts &
   Culture:

1- What Came First

   An interactive game where students pick which comes first. The faster
   students answer, the more points they get. Students are provided with
   two visual prompts and are asked to click on the one that is
   chronologically older.

   These visual prompts come in different forms including: pictures of
   artists, architectural symbols, museums, inventors, and many more. Once
   students choose an answer they can then scroll down to read more on the
   visual prompts.

2- Cultural Crosswords

   A game which helps students develop their cultural literacy through
   word puzzles. Crosswords are arranged into four main categories: Arts,
   Around the World, Science and Technology, Fashion, and Nature. Students
   can choose to play crosswords in each of these categories or play those
   featured in the weekly crosswords section.

   Once they select the crossword they want to play they can click on
   Clues to start filling up the crossword. When students click on a clue
   they can view detailed information about it on Google Arts & Culture.

3- Puzzle Party

   is simple and easy: First students select the artwork they want to

   They can click on  `Learn More' to access more information about the
   artwork in Google Arts & Culture. Next, they choose whether they want
   to play the jigsaw game solo or with others. For the latter option, a
   unique code is generated to share with others.

4- Visual Crosswords

   This game enables students to learn more about arts and culture through
   unexpected pairings. For instance, to learn more about Art Movements,
   students are provided with two columns and are asked to drag artworks
   to boxes anywhere they match the labels. If they are not familiar with
   a particular artwork they can click on Learn More to read about it on
   Google Arts and Culture.

5- Art Coloring Book

   Art Coloring Book Art Coloring Book

   A game that lets students color their way `through the palettes of
   famous paintings'. To start playing it, they need to choose an artwork
   then use the provided tools to colour and customize it the way they
   want.

   Once completed, they can download their artwork or share it with others
   on social media or through a generated link. There is also the option
   to print out coloring books so students can work on them offline.

Final thoughts

   From "What Came First" to "Art Coloring Book," each of the featured
   culture games has been crafted not just to educate but to captivate,
   turning every click and puzzle piece into a conversation with history
   and culture. Whether through the immediacy of a timed quiz or the
   contemplative pace of a crossword, students are invited to a dance of
   learning that's both intuitive and insightful.

   As students engage with these games, they get to broaden their cultural
   horizons and develop invaluable skills like empathy, critical thinking,
   and cross-cultural communication. Indeed, Google Arts & Culture is
   opening doors to a globally connected classroom without walls, where
   learning is as boundless as the creativity it celebrates.
