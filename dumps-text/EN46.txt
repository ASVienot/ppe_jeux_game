Active Games

   child obstacle course

1. Obstacle Course

   Everyone loves a good obstacle course. You can create one in your own
   backyard using objects like a play tunnel, a balance beam, hula hoops,
   string, pool noodles, and more. Set up a simple course for little ones
   and model how to complete it before letting them go through. Get your
   older kids involved by having each person be responsible for creating
   one obstacle for the course. You can time them as they go and have them
   try to beat their previous time. Or set up two courses side by side and
   race!

2. Scooter Races

   All you need for this game are some scooter boards and a driveway or
   sidewalk. Let your children race each other while sitting on the
   scooter boards.

   Mix it up by playing `red light, green light'. Have one person stand at
   the finish line and say "green light" letting the others move forward
   on their scooters. When the person says "red light" everyone must stop.
   If someone keeps scootering forward, they are either out or must start
   back at the beginning (depending on which rules you want to follow).
   The first person on a scooter who reaches the end (you can draw a line
   with chalk) wins. Then that person can be in charge of yelling "red
   light, green light".

3. Animal Tag

   Spice up a regular game of tag with Animal Tag. Designate one area to
   be the "cage" where players will be sent if they are tagged. Choose one
   child to be "it"; They will be the zookeeper responsible for tagging
   all of the animals and sending them back to their "cage". Choose
   another child to be the mischievous "monkey"; They can tag players to
   let them out of the cage.

   Divide the rest of the children into groups. How many groups depends on
   the number of players, but overall you can have one group hop like
   rabbits, frogs, or kangaroos, another gallop like horses, zebras, or
   antelope, another group run like cheetahs or lions, another can crawl
   like dogs, pigs, or bears or even skip. Choose animals based on your
   theme whether it's the zoo and a cage or a barnyard and a barn.

   For more of a challenge, create different cage areas for each group. Or
   turn it into a game of freeze tag and let the monkey unfreeze the other
   players by tagging them.

4. Four Square

   Four Square requires a large flat area, a piece of chalk, a kickball,
   and at least four players. Start by drawing a large square divided into
   four using the piece of chalk. Starting in the top left square, label
   them King, Queen, Jack, and Baby (you could also just label them 1-4).

   Randomly assign children the squares to start. As the game progresses,
   they'll attempt to move into the higher squares. If the "King" is out,
   they either start over at "Baby" or must get in line to wait to get
   back in, depending on the number of players.

   The "Baby" starts with the ball and serves it into another square. The
   next player must hit it into the next square after one bounce. Players
   must continue to bounce the ball from one square to the next. If a
   player hits it out of bounds or can't pass it before it bounces once,
   they're out.

   Variations
     * Around the World: Players must pass the ball clockwise. The hitter
       can call out reverse to switch the order before hitting it to now
       pass from counterclockwise.
     * Around the World No Reverse: Same as above, but you can't reverse
       it.
     * Categories: Let the King choose a category, like food (state, movie
       star, colors, etc.). Each player must name an item in the category
       when they hit it, without repeating something that was previously
       said. If they repeat something, they're out.
     * Extra Rules
          + Bus Stop: If the King calls "bus stop", everyone must ignore
            the ball and run to touch the center where all four squares
            meet with their foot, the last one to do so is out.
          + Ballerina Feet: If the King calls "ballerina feet", the
            players must all rush to their corner and get into first
            position in ballet (heels together, toes out following the
            corner's lines), the last one to do so is out.
          + Train: If the King calls "train" everyone must quickly get
            onto a line. The other players can shuffle along the lines
            while the King shuffles and tries to tag someone, the person
            tagged is out.
          + Tea Party: If the King calls "tea party with XYZ" those two
            players must bounce the ball back and forth until someone is
            out.

5. Bicycle Fun

   Bikes are another fun outdoor activity. With trikes, bicycles, and
   adaptive tricycles, most children will have fun riding their bikes
   around the neighborhood. You can add games too. Play "How Slow Can You
   Go" with a piece of chalk. Draw out a straight or wavy line and time
   your kids to see who can go the slowest without stopping or needing to
   put their foot down. Or create obstacles using cones or cans and have
   your children maneuver around them.

   agility cones
   Buy on Amazon!

6. Sharks and Minnows

   If you've got a group of kids, this game is a perfect alternative when
   tag starts to get a bit boring. Designate one or more players to be the
   "shark" they will try to tag the minnows. The rest of the players are
   "minnows" and should stand together in a straight line at one end of
   the playing field, all facing the shark in the middle of the field.
   When the shark yells "Swim!" all of the minnows should try to run to
   the other side of the field without being tagged.

   If a minnow is tagged, there are two possible options: You can have
   them become "seaweed" having them sit down and try to reach out for
   other minnows to turn them into seaweed too. Or you can have them
   become additional sharks for the next round.

   Play continues until only one minnow remains untagged, they become the
   new lead shark. This game can also be played in a gym class or in the
   pool.

7. Kick the Can

   All you need for this game is an empty can and a group of participants.
   Place the can in a large open area. Choose one player to be "It" who
   should then count to 50 while the other players hide. Then It tries to
   find and tag all of the other players. If another player is tagged,
   they must go to the designated "jail" area near the can. Any player who
   hasn't been tagged can try to "kick the can" to set all of the players
   in jail free. When It has all of the players in jail, they win. Whoever
   was in jail the longest becomes the new It and a new game starts.

8. Opinion Tag

   Decide on four spots to be bases. Label them "Love it" "Okay" "Don't
   like it" "Never tried it". Choose one person to be "It". It chooses a
   food, sport, activity, etc. and yells it out loud. For example
   "baseball" or "carrots" or "Spanish class". All of the other players
   must run to the base that describes how they feel about the chosen
   subject. It tries to tag one of the players as they run. If a player is
   tagged, they become the new It for the next round.

Water Games

9. Sponge Tennis

   For this game, you'll need a balloon and a sponge on a stick. You can
   make your own by using a large sponge, a painter's stick or ruler, and
   tape to wrap around the handle and prevent splinters. Or purchase a
   sponge on a stick for a quicker solution. Children can then bat the
   ball back and forth to play "tennis", add a net to enhance the game. Or
   simply attempt to keep the balloon in the air by working together.

   For extra fun, head outside. Fill a bucket with water and dip the
   sponges into it, then play this game with wet sponges! A scrub brush
   sponge stick is designed to get wet!

10. Water Cup Races

   Get two plastic cups and poke a hole in the bottom center of each. Tie
   a string to a secure anchor point, thread a string through the cup and
   tie the other end to another secure point (like a tree branch or
   chair). Bring both cups to the end of their respective strings and hand
   each child a filled water gun. Have the children shoot the water into
   the cups to push the cups along the string. Race to see who can get
   their cup to the end of the string first!

11. Sponge Tag

   Easy to set up and tons of fun, all you need for this game is a bucket
   of water and a large car wash sponge. Choose one child to be "It". It
   should take the sponge and dunk it in the bucket. Then It chases the
   other players trying to tag them with the wet sponge. The first person
   tagged becomes It and refills the sponge.

12. Frozen Feet

   Perfect for cooling down on a hot day, you'll need ice cubes to play
   this game. There are two versions of this game.

   Version 1: Fill a tub with ice cubes and place an empty tub beside it.
   Set a time limit (1-2 minutes). See how many ice cubes one child can
   move from the filled bucket to the empty bucket using only their feet.
   Then empty the second bin and let another child try. Whoever can move
   the most cubes within the set amount of time wins!

   Version two: Fill one tub with ice cubes, water, and marbles. See how
   many marbles one child can pick up from within the tub using only their
   feet in a given time limit. Put the marbles back in the tub and let
   another child try. Whoever gets the most marbles wins!

13. Over Under Sponge Relay

   For this game you'll need two large sponges and two buckets that are
   the same size and two large tubs filled with water. Divide the children
   into two groups and have each group stand in a line. Place the full
   tubs in front of the lines and the empty buckets at the end of the
   lines.

   Hand the large sponge to the first person in line. They must dunk the
   sponge and pass it over their head to the next person in line. That
   person must pass it under their legs to the next person who then passes
   it over their head... and so on. The last child in line squeezes the
   sponge out into the bucket then runs to the front of the line and the
   relay continues. The first team to fill their bucket wins.

   If you think this will take too much time, use a small bucket or
   sharpie a fill-to line on the inside of the bucket.

14. Melt the Ice

   This game requires a bit of prep work. But it can be used with a
   variety of ages and played individually or in a group.

   Play individually or cooperatively: Get a large container and fill with
   one inch of water, then play a few small toys and freeze. Add more
   water and toys and freeze again. Repeat the process for each layer
   until the container is full. Remove the block of ice and give your
   child tools to melt it. (spoons, salt, paintbrushes, spray bottles,
   etc.) to try and melt the ice and retrieve their treasures.

   Play in a group: This version is a bit easier to prepare. Just fill an
   ice cube tray with one penny and water. Then freeze. Give each child
   one ice cube and see who can melt it (not break it) in their hands
   first and get to the penny. That child is the winner and everyone gets
   to keep a penny!

15. DIY Sprinkler

   Sometimes unstructured play is best. Have your child help you create
   this sprinkler. You'll need a sturdy plastic bottle, a drill, tape, and
   a garden hose. Use the drill to make holes in the bottle, if you have
   older children you can supervise as they do this step. Then securely
   tape the container to the end of the garden hose. Turn on the water for
   an instant sprinkler! Your children can run through it, jump over it,
   and have plenty of fun

   Looking for fun sprinkler games? Your children can play ring-around-the
   rosy, hokey pokey freeze dance, and more around the sprinkler.

16. Water Balloon Toss

   This game is a lot like an egg toss but the water balloons instead.
   Start by filling several water balloons. Have the children divide into
   pairs and give each pair one water balloon. Have the children start
   close together and throw the water balloon back and forth. On each
   successful throw, have both children take another step back. If the
   water balloon breaks or the pair fails to make a catch, they're out.
   The team that ends up the furthest apart wins!

17. Water Limbo

   All you need for this water game is a hose. Have an adult hold the hose
   up high with water streaming out of it. Children can take turns
   limboing under the stream. After each round, the adult should lower the
   hose. If the child can't make it under the steam, they'll get soaked
   and be out! Last one limboing wins!

18. Drip, Drip Drench!

   This twist on `duck, duck, goose' includes fun water play. Have all of
   the children sit in a circle, except the child who is "It". The person
   who is "It" should walk around the circle holding a sopping wet sponge
   over each child's head. As they pass they should say "Drip, drip, drip"
   until they get to a chosen player and say "Drench" squeezing the sponge
   over the person's head. The chosen player gets up and chases it around
   the circle trying to tag them. It tries to make it around the circle
   once and to sit in the chosen player's spot. If It is tagged, they must
   sit in the center of the circle until someone else is tagged. The
   chosen player becomes the next It. Resoak the sponge and start again!

19. Ping Pong Toss

   Grab a ping pong ball, a sharpie, and several plastic cups. Label the
   cups numbers 1-5. Fill the cups halfway with water and set the cups up
   so the ones labelled 1 are closer and the ones labelled higher numbers
   are further away. Give a child five ping pong balls and let them throw
   them into the cups for points. You could also let the children throw as
   many ping pong balls as they can in thirty seconds. Then let the next
   child take a turn. The child with the most points wins.

Messy Games

20. Egg Roulette and Other Egg Games

   You may want to put down a cheap plastic throw away tarp for these
   games.

   Egg Roulette: Fill a bowl with several boiled eggs and one raw egg
   hidden in the mix. One at a time the child should crack an egg on their
   head until one breaks.

   Egg Toss: Divide the children into pairs and give each pair one raw
   egg. They must toss the egg back and forth, taking a step back after
   each successful toss. The winners get the most distance between them
   without dropping the egg.

   Egg and Spoon Race: Give each child one raw egg and one spoon. The
   first child to get to the finish line and back without dropping their
   egg wins. If the egg drops, the child must start over from the start
   line. If the egg breaks, they're out.

21. Rainbow Tag

   This fun face paint game mixes tag, with capture the flag. You will
   need five tongue depressors, each marked with a color of the rainbow.
   You will also need matching face paint colors. Hide the tongue
   depressor and matching face paint in a variety of places around the
   yard.

   Choose someone to be "It". All of the other players run off in search
   of the sticks. When they find a stick, they should put a stripe of the
   matching face paint on their cheek and then continue searching without
   letting anyone else know where the stick is.

   In the meantime, the It tries to tag the other players. If It tags a
   player, It can wipe off one stripe of color from their face.

   The first player to get stripes of each color on their face wins!

22. Squirt Gun Painting/Tag

   For these games you'll need squirt guns filled with liquid watercolors.

   Squirt Gun Painting: Set up easels with paper or tack paper to a tree.
   Fill each squirt gun with a different color. Then give each child a
   squirt gun and let them spray the paper to paint it. Your children can
   switch guns to mix different colors.

   Squirt Gun Tag: Make sure everyone is wearing a white shirt that can
   get dirty. Fill the squirt guns with two different liquid watercolors
   and divide everyone into teams. If you get squirted by the other team's
   gun, you've been "hit" and you're out. Continue until only one player
   remains standing that team wins!

   To extend the game, play the color wars version. Individually or in
   teams, each child tries to get the others to be as colorful as possible
   (if a child is "hit" they aren't out). The child with the most white
   remaining on their shirt at the end of a designated time wins!

   Bean Bag Ladder: Set up a ladder and label each step to be worth a

   the ladder rungs for points. The player with the most points after
   everyone has taken a turn wins.

   Hula Blockers: Grab a hula hoop for each player and set them in the
   grass. Have each child stand in a hula hoop and divide the bean bags
   evenly between them. Each child should try to throw the bean bag into

   hoop. For an added challenge, play with more than 2 kids.

25. Ball Pit Search

   Set up a cheap ball pit using a kiddie pool and ball pit balls. Choose
   small toys or stuffed animals to hide in the balls. Then let your child
   search for the toys within the ball pit. You could turn it into a
   competition by seeing who can find the most toys the fastest. Hide the
   toys again and replay.

26. Giant Games

   Twister: Play a giant game of twister on the yard. You'll need a
   spinner from a regular game of Twister or by creating it yourself. Then
   use four spray paint cans to create a board on the grass and play
   regular Twister. You'll have a fun game to play until the grass is
   mowed.

   Tic-Tac-Toe: You can use the same spray paint to create a giant
   tic-tac-toe board. Choose items like hula hoops or other items to play
   tic-tac-toe!

   involved by having them help create the cards by drawing pictures using
   markers. Then set up the board with the cards facing down and play a
   giant version of memory!

27. Sidewalk Chalk Simon

   Have you ever played the electronic Simon game? Make it interactive and
   physical with this sidewalk chalk game. Create a Simon game board out
   of chalk. Form a circle with sections of color.

   Have your child stand in the middle of the board. Call out a color and
   have your child jump into the section, repeat it, and then jump into
   the center again. Next, say the first color and a new color and have
   your child repeat the jumping sequence. Continue adding colors until
   your child can no longer remember the sequence.

   Switch it up by using numbers, letters, or other pictures in the
   sections instead.

28. Snakes and Worms

   Get green and brown strings and cut them into several pieces. Hide the
   pieces of yarn around the yard. Divide the children into two groups and
   choose one captain. The children will run around the yard looking for
   yarn. And the captain's will stand in the center of the yard and tie
   the yarn onto together to create a long worm/snake. The team with the
   longest piece of string wins.

29. Quarter Bounce

   All you need for this simple game is a quarter and a bouncy ball. Place
   the quarter in the sidewalk crack. Have one child stand on each square
   and bounce the ball attempting to knock the quarter out. The first
   child to knock the quarter out of the sidewalk crack wins.

30. Marbles

   This classic game requires sidewalk chalk, small marbles, and large
   marbles. Use the chalk to draw a three foot diameter circle with a line
   through the center. Each player needs a large marble to use as a
   "shooter". Place 10-15 marbles in the center of the circle. Shoot your
   marble by flicking it from the ground. Grab whatever marbles you manage
   to knock out of the circle. Continue knocking marbles out until none
   remain. Whoever has the most marbles at the end wins.

   If you don't knock a marble out of the circle, you must leave your
   "shooter" in play. If the other player knocks it out on their turn,
   they win and the game ends. Otherwise you may pick it up again on your
   next turn.

31. Simon Says

   Choose one player to be "Simon". Simon will give commands to the other
   players. If Simon begins the command by saying "Simon Says" everyone
   must follow the command. If Simon begins the command without saying
   "Simon Says" players aren't allowed to do the action.

   For example, if Simon says, "Simon Says touch your toes!" you must
   touch your toes, if you don't, you're out. If Simon says, "Touch your
   toes!" you shouldn't touch your toes. If you do, you're out.

   The last player standing wins and gets to be Simon for the next round.

32. Scavenger Hunt

   Create a scavenger hunt for your children to do out in the backyard.
   You can hide written clues for them to find and follow to a treasure.
   For example, a clue like "Climb up and then down, down you go. Look for
   me on the ground below" could lead your child to the area under the
   slide to find the next clue.

   Or create a list of objects (a stick, a leaf, a round stone, etc.) that
   they need to find. The first one to find all of the objects on the list
   wins and gets a prize.
