   Common pheasant, widely introduced and hunted as game

   Game or quarry is any wild animal hunted for animal products (primarily
   meat), for recreation ("sporting"), or for trophies.^[1] The species of
   animals hunted as game varies in different parts of the world and by
   different local jurisdictions, though most are terrestrial mammals and
   birds. Fish caught non-commercially (recreational fishing) are also
   referred to as game fish.

By continent and region[edit]

   The range of animal species hunted by humans varies in different parts
   of the world. This is influenced by climate, faunal diversity, popular
   taste and locally accepted views about what can or cannot be
   legitimately hunted. Sometimes a distinction is also made between
   varieties and breeds of a particular animal, such as wild turkey and
   domestic turkey. The flesh of the animal, when butchered for
   consumption, is often described as having a "gamey" flavour. This
   difference in taste can be attributed to the natural diet of the
   animal, which usually results in a lower fat content compared to
   domestic farm-raised animals.

   In some countries, game is classified, including legal classifications
   with respect to licenses required, as either "small game" or "large
   game". A single small game licence may cover all small game species and
   be subject to yearly bag limits. Large game are often subject to
   individual licensing where a separate permit is required for each
   individual animal taken (tags).

Africa[edit]

   and local guides with his kill, 1970

   In some parts of Africa, wild animals hunted for their meat are called
   bushmeat; see that article for more detailed information on how this
   operates within the economy (for personal consumption and for money)
   and the law (including overexploitation and illegal imports). Animals
   hunted for bushmeat include, but are not limited to:
     * Various species of antelope, including duikers
     * Various species of primates like mandrills or gorillas
     * Rodents like porcupines or cane rats

   Some of these animals are endangered or otherwise protected, and thus
   it is illegal to hunt them.

   In Africa, animals hunted for their pelts or ivory are sometimes
   referred to as big game.

   Also see the legal definition of game in Eswatini.^[2]

South Africa[edit]

   South Africa is a famous destination for game hunting, with its large
   biodiversity and therefore impressive variety of game species. Many
   creatures have returned to former areas from which they were once taken
   as a result of being killed for big-game hunting. Commonly hunted
   species include:
     * Springbok
     * Impala
     * Steenbok
     * Oribi
     * Bushbuck
     * Nyala
     * Greater Kudu
     * Common Eland
     * Blue Wildebeest
     * Black Wildebeest
     * Blesbok
     * Bontebok
     * Sable Antelope
     * Roan Antelope
     * Gemsbok
     * Giraffe
     * Cape Buffalo
     * Southern White Rhinoceros
     * Plains Zebra

   South Africa also has 62 species of gamebirds, including guineafowl,
   francolin, partridge, quail, sandgrouse, duck, geese, snipe, bustard
   and korhaan. Some of these species are no longer hunted, and of the 44
   indigenous gamebirds that can potentially be utilised in South Africa,
   only three, namely the yellow-throated sandgrouse, Delegorgue's pigeon
   and the African pygmy goose warrant special protection. Of the
   remaining 41 species, 24 have shown an increase in numbers and
   distribution range in the last 25 years or so. The status of 14 species
   appears unchanged, with insufficient information being available for
   the remaining three species. The gamebirds of South Africa where the
   population status in 2005 was secure or growing are listed below:
     * Helmeted guineafowl
     * Greywing partridge
     * Redwing partridge
     * Orange River partridge
     * Cape francolin
     * Natal francolin
     * Swainson's francolin
     * Common quail
     * Harlequin quail
     * Namaqua sandgrouse
     * Double-banded sandgrouse
     * Burchell's sandgrouse
     * White-faced duck
     * Egyptian goose
     * Yellow-billed duck
     * Red-billed teal
     * Cape shoveler
     * Southern pochard
     * Knob-billed duck
     * Spur-winged goose

   In the UK game is defined in law by the Game Act 1831. It is illegal to
   shoot game on Sundays or at night. Other non-game birds that are hunted
   for food in the UK are specified under the Wildlife and Countryside Act
   1981. UK law defines game as including:
     * Black grouse (No longer hunted due to decline in numbers)
     * Red grouse
     * Brown hare
     * Rock ptarmigan
     * Grey and red-legged partridges
     * Common pheasant

   Deer are not included in the definition, but similar controls provided
   to those in the Game Act apply to deer (from the Deer Act 1991). Deer
   hunted in the UK are:
     * Red deer
     * Roe deer
     * Fallow deer
     * Sika deer
     * Muntjac deer
     * Chinese water deer
     * and hybrids of these deer

   Other animals which are hunted in the UK include:
     * Duck, including mallard, tufted duck, teal, northern pintail and
       common pochard
     * Goose, including greylag goose, Canada goose and pink-footed goose
     * Wood pigeon
     * Cuckoo
     * Eurasian woodcock
     * Common snipe
     * Rabbit
     * Eurasian golden plover
     * Corncrake

   Capercaillie are not currently hunted in the UK because of a recent
   decline in numbers and conservation projects towards their recovery.
   The ban is generally considered voluntary on private lands, and few
   birds live away from RSPB or Forestry Commission land allegedly.

   Game meat is typically taken from a wild animal that has been shot with
   a gun or bow. Hunters must be absolutely certain of their target before
   shooting and should make every effort to get the animal down as quickly
   and painlessly as possible. Once obtained, game meat must be processed
   to avoid spoiling. The method of processing varies by game species and
   size. Small game and fowl may simply be carried home to be butchered.
   Large game such as deer is quickly field-dressed by removing the
   viscera in the field, while very large animals like moose may be
   partially butchered in the field because of the difficulty of removing
   them intact from their habitat. Commercial processors often handle deer
   taken during deer seasons, sometimes even at supermarket meat counters.
   Otherwise the hunter handles butchering. The carcass is kept cool to
   minimize spoilage.

   Traditionally, game meat was hung until "high" or "gamey", that is,
   approaching a state of decomposition.^[4] However, this adds to the
   risk of contamination. Small game can be processed essentially intact,
   after gutting and skinning or defeathering (by species). Small animals
   are ready for cooking, although they may be disjointed first. Large
   game must be processed by techniques commonly practiced by commercial
   butchers.

Cooking[edit]

   Wikibooks Cookbook has a recipe/module on
     * Game

   Generally game is cooked in the same ways as farmed meat.^[5] Because
   some game meat is leaner than store-bought beef, overcooking is a
   common mishap which can be avoided if properly prepared.^[6]^[7] It is
   sometimes grilled or cooked longer or by slow cooking or moist-heat
   methods to make it more tender, since some game tends to be tougher
   than farm-raised meat. Other methods of tenderizing include marinating
   as in the dish Hasenpfeffer, cooking in a game pie or as a stew such as
   burgoo.

Safety[edit]

   The Norwegian Food Safety Authority considers that children, pregnant
   women, fertile-aged women, and people with high blood pressure should
   not consume game shot with lead-based ammunition more than once a
   month. Children who often eat such game might develop a slightly lower
   IQ, as lead influences the development of the central nervous
   system.^[8]
