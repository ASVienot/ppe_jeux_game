   Background: Internet gaming disorder (IGD) was recently added in the
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder as a "condition
   for further studies." There is no consensus regarding which rating
   scales should be used but many scholars suggest the GASA (Game
   Addiction Scale for Adolescents) and a ranking of the criteria, "the
   core approach" to avoid over-diagnosing of disordered gaming. Male
   gender and ADHD are commonly listed as risk factors for disordered
   gaming but little is known about sex differences in gaming and gender
   specific health correlates.

   Purpose: The present study aims to evaluate the core approach and the
   specific indicators of gaming behavior in GASA from a multifactorial
   perspective and explore the gender differences in a clinical setting,
   focusing on ADHD.

   Patients and Methods: Children and adolescents aged 8-18 years (n =
   144) from Child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) in Skane were assessed
   with the GASA. Psychometric analyses including confirmatory factor
   analyses (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to
   identify well-defined constructs and gender differences. Refined factor
   scores for single constructs were the outcome of alignment, a procedure
   for assessing measurement equivalence across gender. New model-based
   gaming behavior variables were used for descriptive statistics and
   ANOVA testing of gender differences.

   Results: The results confirm that the core approach two-factor model is
   valid for the CAP sample, as well as a theory based psycho-social model
   for gaming behavior with over consumption and negative social and
   emotional consequences. Our findings suggest that negative consequences
   of over consumption take a social direction for boys and an emotional
   direction for girls. Also, ADHD was significantly associated with over
   consumption of video games and the negative consequences thereof for
   girls.

   Conclusion: Guided by psychometric analyses, the GASA could be
   strengthened by advancing the questionnaire design and by adding
   complementary items in order to illuminate the complexity of gaming
   behavior. Our findings suggest that additional research on potential
   gender related discrepancies of disordered gaming is needed.

Introduction

   In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)
   the American Psychiatry Association (APA) identified Internet Gaming
   Disorder as a tentative diagnose; a "condition for further studies"
   (1). Nine criteria for IGD has been proposed: preoccupation,
   preoccupation with gaming; withdrawal, experience of unpleasant
   symptoms when gaming is taken away; tolerance, the need to spend
   increasing amounts of time engaged in games; loss of control,
   unsuccessful attempts to control participation in games; Give up other
   activities, loss of interest in previous hobbies and entertainment as a
   result of, and with the exception of, internet games; continuation,
   continued excessive gaming despite knowledge of psychosocial problems;
   deception, deceiving family members, therapists, or others regarding
   the quantity of gaming; escape, the use of games to avoid or relieve
   negative moods; and negative consequences, risking or losing an
   important relationship, job or education or career opportunity due to
   participation in games. Five of the nine criteria must be met within a
   year to be diagnosed as IGD (1). However, APA indicated that further
   clinical experience and research was needed before inclusion of IGD as
   a formal disorder (1).

   In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) included Gaming Disorder
   (GD) in the 11th revision of the International Classification of
   Diseases (ICD 11) (2). According to ICD-11 a patient must exhibit three
   symptoms (impaired control, increasing priority given to gaming,
   continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative
   consequences) to be officially diagnosed with GD (2). Consequently, the
   criteria withdrawal and tolerance which concerns rather biological
   consequences is excluded from the ICD-11 GD diagnosis criteria.

   There is no consensus regarding which rating scales should be used for
   diagnosing disordered gaming and different scales are used both in
   research and in clinical practice. Most studies have used the criteria
   for pathological gambling to define the pathological gaming (3, 4).
   Different researchers have used different cutoffs of the criteria to
   establish a diagnosis (5-8), others have focused strictly on online
   games (9), and some researchers have adopted their own criteria for
   disordered gaming (10, 11). One of the most frequently used
   questionnaires for disordered gaming in adolescents is the GASA (Game
   Addiction Scale for Adolescents) (12-16). GASA was developed
   specifically for adolescents. The items in the GASA relate to homework
   and relationship to parents, designed to correspond to the
   developmental stage of an adolescent (15). The adult version of the
   GASA; Game Addiction Scale (GAS) has been showed to provide both good
   reliability and validity and in a review of different instruments
   assessing disordered gaming King et al., found that GAS was one of two
   scales that provided the best clinical information for the diagnosis of
   disordered gaming (16). King et al. reviewed 32 different scales and
   found that GAS was one out of five tools that had greater evidential
   support regarding psychometric properties (16). Finserås et al.
   verified this finding in their evaluation of the adolescent version of
   the scale (GASA) in relationship to the nine criteria for disordered
   gaming suggested by the APA (17). In 2019 Donati et al. developed and
   evaluated a Video-Gaming-Scale--For Children (VGS-C), aiming to assess
   pathological gaming behavior in children specifically (18). The GASA
   has the advantage of being a well-established and well-proven
   assessment of disordered gaming (12-17). However, the scale has to our
   knowledge not yet been evaluated in a child and adolescent sample.

   GASA was theoretically based on seven of the DSM-5 criteria for
   pathological gambling: salience (exaggerated preoccupation in thoughts
   and habits), tolerance, mood modification, withdrawal, relapse,
   conflicts, and problems (15). When diagnosing pathological gamblers,
   the DSM-5 requires at least half of their criteria to be met while
   scholars in the gaming research field prefer a ranking of the criteria,
   which they call "the core approach" (1, 5, 12-14, 19). These scholars
   believe that the criteria for tolerance, mood modification and
   cognitive salience are associated with engagement and not necessarily
   with addiction while the contrary is true for the criteria for
   withdrawal, relapse, conflicts and problems (5, 13, 14). The core
   approach thus distinguishes engaged gamers from problem- and addicted
   gamers by emphasizing the "core criteria" namely, withdrawal, relapse,
   conflict and problems in order to yield a more precise and relevant
   estimate of prevalence whereby a diagnosis of game addiction should be
   related to comorbidity and interference rather than high engagement
   (13, 14, 17, 20).

   The psychometric properties of GAS have been tested among adult men in
   Switzerland showing satisfactory internal consistency (21), and in a
   population of Iranian adolescents supporting the measurement invariance
   also across gender (22). Brunborg et al. evaluated the core approach
   using a confirmatory factor analysis showing that a two-factor
   structure (peripheral criteria separated from core criteria) fitted
   their data better than the original one-factor structure. The same
   applied for groups of men and women, both aged 16-33 years and for
   those aged 34-74 years (13). However, when Brunborg et al. evaluated
   the two-factor solution no evidence was found for metric invariance,
   implicating that comparison between different subpopulations should be
   done with caution (13). Charlton and Danford contributed with an
   influential distinction between peripheral and core symptomatology in
   terms of gaming, early in the field of gaming research. Consistent with
   the Brunborg et al. research they considered cognitive salience,
   tolerance, and mood modification as a peripheral group of symptoms,
   though with a potential to develop into disordered gaming in certain
   circumstances (5, 19). Concordantly, they suggested an existence of a
   developmental process whereby the peripheral criteria precede the core
   criteria (5).

   Jonsson et al. evaluated a self-test, GamTest, for online gambling,
   largely similar to GASA. These researchers identified two main
   components of early signs of problematic gambling: over consumption
   (OC) and negative consequences (NC) (23). The peripheral criteria
   correspond to over consumption and the core criteria to the negative
   consequences. The negative consequences items where further divided
   conceptually into a social and an emotional part, corresponding to the
   dimensions in GamTest (23). The application of this psycho-social model
   specification enables an exploration of over consumption as an
   explanatory variable for problematic use of games rather than just
   charting peripheral components, in accordance with the Charlton and
   Danford suggestion that the peripheral criteria might precede the core
   criteria (5, 23).

   International studies have found the prevalence of disordered gaming to
   range between 1.3 and 6.8 percent (24). Stevens et al. report that the
   prevalence of disordered gaming worldwide in a meta-analysis is 3.05
   percent (25). The differences in prevalence are likely due to
   differences in assessment methods, sample characteristics, and cultures
   in different countries (24, 26). Child and adolescent psychiatrists as
   well as school health care workers have reported disordered gaming
   among their patients and students. These clinicians describe
   compulsion, psychiatric and physical symptoms and impaired school
   performance as components of the disorder (27, 28). Most research on
   disordered gaming reports that males are more likely than females to
   experience disordered gaming (25, 27, 29-31) and the prevalence rates
   are commonly higher in adolescent samples (24, 25). Several previous
   studies report on the association between ADHD and disordered gaming
   (29, 32, 33) and DSM-5 lists ADHD as a comorbidity of IGD (1).
   Stavropoulos et al. presented a theory on gender dependent ADHD
   characteristics as a possible explanation to the gender discrepancy
   regarding disordered gaming (29). However, sex differences in gaming
   and potential gender specific health correlates are poorly understood.

   In summary, the GASA is an established measure of gaming behavior, but
   the psychometric properties of the scale have previously mainly been
   investigated in adult or adolescent populations (16, 24, 25). Male
   gender and ADHD are frequently reported as risk factors for disordered
   gaming (24, 25, 29, 32, 33) but no previous research has to our
   knowledge evaluated how these factors relate to the components in GASA.
   This study contributes to the knowledge of gaming, using a clinical
   sample of children and adolescents to explore the psychosocial
   dimensions of the GASA.

   The present study evaluates the indicators of gaming behavior in GASA
   from a multifactorial perspective and explores the gender differences
   in a clinical setting, focusing on ADHD. Both the two-factor core
   approach and an alternative three-factor version are analyzed
   psychometrically. The study aims are specified as follows:

   1. Explore the dimensionality of the items in GASA and the potential
   impact of gender and/or ADHD.

   2. Analyze the fitting of the two-factor core approach on the CAP
   sample.

   3. Analyze the fitting of an adapted three-factor version of the core
   approach on the CAP sample, by dividing the core items into social and
   emotional categories.

Methods

Participants

   The study was performed in Skane, a county in the south of Sweden with
   1.36 million inhabitants, of which 280,000 are individuals under 18
   years of age. In 2018 CAP Skane had 55,000 unique visits. There are
   seven out-patient child and adolescent psychiatry units in Skane and
   one in-patient unit. The out-patient units cater for all types of child
   and adolescent diagnoses but have no assignment to either diagnose or
   treat addiction problems. In the present study, patients coming to the
   Child and Adolescent Psychiatry clinic (in- and out-patient
   departments, respectively) in Skane during the study period of 4 months
   (Feb-May) during 2020 were asked to participate. Clinicians
   (psychologists, psychiatrists) were systematically provided with
   questionnaires and were asked to distribute these to their patients.
   The study was approved by the Ethics committee (Dnr: 2019-02967).
   Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and their
   parents/guardians.

   The survey was answered by 144 children and adolescents between 8 and
   18 years of age. Six individuals participated without sharing social
   security number which made the collecting of other information (gender,
   age, diagnosis) impossible. One individual abstained from answering the
   GASA-items. Concordantly, seven individuals were excluded from the data
   file leaving 137 individuals, characteristics specified in Table 1. The
   gender distribution was even, most of the participants were recruited
   through outpatient care and a majority were older than 13 years. The
   mean age was 14.5 years. The participant's main as well as secondary
   diagnosis, when applicable, was registered. The diagnoses were referred
   to as the Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, describes them (1).
   ADHD was the most prevalent diagnosis. Other diagnoses that occurred
   were depression, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, eating disorder,
   anxiety/depression, bipolar disease, obsessive compulsive disorder,
   social phobia, and psychosis. All patients were assessed in clinical
   settings by trained psychologists and child and adolescent
   psychiatrists.

   Concerning sample size for the GASA analyses, the Price guidelines are
   for a minimum sample size equal to 105 (7 items × 15 patients) (34).
   The CAP sample includes n = 137 observations and accordingly fulfills
   the requirements according to guidelines (34).

Measures

   One of the most used questionnaires for disordered gaming in
   adolescents is GASA (Game Addiction Scale for Adolescents), constructed
   by Lemmens et al. (13-17). The seven-item GASA applies to gaming
   behavior in the last 6 months, see Table 2. Each item concerns one
   criterion, answered on a five-point scale: 1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 =
   sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = very often and should be considered endorsed
   when rated 3 or higher (15).
   TABLE 2
   www.frontiersin.org

   Table 2. GASA, peripheral and core items corresponding to OC and NC,
   respectively.

   With support from previous research, empirical data and theoretical
   reasoning (5, 13-15, 19, 23, 35, 36) the GASA items were associated
   with the different factors in a psycho-social conceptual model to
   enable testing of a two-factor approach (core approach) and a
   three-factor approach, in which the peripheral items/negative
   consequences were differentiated into negative consequences social and
   negative consequences emotional, see Table 2. The psychosocial
   conceptual model is guiding the specification of measurement and
   structural models analyzed. For details see Supplementary Diagram 1 and
   paragraph 3 (conceptual model) and 4 (GASA instrument) in the
   electronic supplement. This model specification aims to consider over
   consumption as an explanatory variable for problematic use of games
   rather than a peripheral component.

   The following variables were obtained from subjects in the study: GASA,
   gender, age, housing situation (with whom you live), type of care given
   at CAP (in-/out-patient care) and diagnosis at CAP.

Statistical Analysis

   Psychometric analyses including confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were
   used to identify constructs captured by the GASA items through
   well-fitting measurement models. These analyses were performed within
   the latent variable framework in Mplus software Version 8.6 (30).
   Robust maximum-likelihood estimation MLR was applied to adjust for
   skewed item distributions in the goodness-of-fit testing. Item analysis
   and trimming of skewed item distributions was performed to improve the
   fulfillment of the requirements of the chi square testing in the CFA
   and SEM analyses Gender differences in GASA measurement models were
   assessed using multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA). In
   order to explore if the latent variables were equivalent across groups,
   test for invariance in measurements were executed for group comparisons
   of CFA models. Factor analysis of multiple groups considers three
   degrees of measurement invariance: configural, metric (also referred to
   as weak factorial invariance) and scalar (strong factorial invariance).
   In the present study, a two-group two factor metric model corresponding
   to the core approach shows acceptable fit. This measurement model with
   equality constraints for corresponding measurement models (metric
   invariance) across gender was used as the outcome variable in a
   multiple-group structural equation model (SEM) to examine gender
   differences exploring direct and indirect effects of a diagnosis of
   ADHD on over consumption and negative consequences social and emotional
   (34). Details are available in the electronic supplement.

   Goodness of Fit Indexes were calculated for the One- Two- and Three
   factor Solutions to the GASA Scale, for the whole sample (n = 137) and
   divided according to gender (male n = 69, female n = 68), with metric
   invariance, with and without equality constraints. Ever being diagnosed
   with ADHD was added as a covariate independent variable, hereafter
   mentioned as ADHD lifetime. The goodness-of-fit of the CFA/SEM models
   was assessed using the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)
   and the comparative fit index (CFI). Values above 0.95 (CFI) and below
   0.08 (RMSEA) were considered acceptable (37, 38).

   A three-factor model in which negative consequences was differentiated
   into social and emotional harm was explored regarding the impact of
   over consumption.

   This measurement model (3.1 gm) was used as a vehicle to test gender
   differences exploring direct and indirect effects of the risk factor
   diagnose ADHD lifetime on over consumption and negative consequences
   social and negative consequences emotional (Model 3.2 gdia).This model
   assumed equality constraints for corresponding measurement models, see
   Table 3.
   TABLE 3
   www.frontiersin.org

   Table 3. Goodness of fit Indexes for the one-, two- and three-factor
   solutions of GASA.

   Factor scores and means optimized for measurement non-invariance across
   gender were computed with the alignment procedure in Mplus based on a
   one-factor model fitted to over consumption items and negative
   consequences items separately (39). Factor scores and means in an
   alignment optimization metric were saved for further post processing in
   SPSS, for details see Supplementary Table 4 in the electronic
   supplement. ANOVA testing of effects by gender and ADHD lifetime
   diagnosis as well as gender and age group were reported with the test
   variable F. All statistical analyses are based on the reduced sample n
   = 137, with no missing data. Details are available in the electronic
   supplement.

Results

Overview of Goodness of Fit Results for GASA CFA and SEM Models

   Model fitting results are reported in Table 3. The Goodness of Fit
   Indexes for models including all 7 items, the one-factor model (model
   1.2) and the two-factor model/core approach (Model 2.1), showed a good
   model fit. The Goodness of Fit index for the two-factor model did not
   meet the cutoff values when the sample was divided by gender. When
   correlation errors between item 5 and 7 and equality constraints were
   added the adjusted two-factor model showed an acceptable fit. The
   three-factor model (model 3.1) showed a good fit for the whole sample
   and when divided by gender and when being diagnosed with ADHD lifetime
   was added as a covariate diagnose.

The Psychometric Model for the Core Approach

   Path Diagram for the two-factor CFA model, peripheral-core approach is
   reported in Figure 1. The peripheral items correspond to over
   consumption (OC) and the core items reflect negative consequences (NC).
   In the measurement Model 2.1 (Figure 1) the estimate of the correlation
   between f (OC) and f (NC) was high, 0.91. The model showed an
   acceptable fit (CFI = 0.973; RMSEA = 0.065) which confirmed that the
   core approach shows a valid factor structure for the total sample n =
   137 (see Figure 1; Table 3).
   FIGURE 1
   www.frontiersin.org

   Figure 1. Model 2.1--GASA CFA 2 all. Two-factor Core approach model,
   OC/Peripheral and NC/Core. OC, over consumption; NC, negative
   consequences.

   The two-factor model (core approach) divided by gender showed a CFI
   value just below 0.95. When inserting the correlation between error
   terms for item 5 (withdrawal) and 7 (neglect duties) in Model 2.1 g
   (the negative consequences emotional factor) the goodness of fit was
   improved, see Figure 2 and Table 3. The correlation between OC and NC
   latent variables was 0.89 for girls and 0.97 for boys.

   two-factor Core approach model, OC/Peripheral and NC/Core. With
   correlated errors between NC item #5 Withdrawal and #7 Neglect duties.

The Three-Factor Model

   The three-factor model showed an acceptable fit (CFI = 0.974; RMSEA =
   0.069) which confirms that this alternative version of the core
   approach constitutes a valid factor structure for the total sample n =
   137. The factor structure remained valid when analyzed with a two-group
   model with equality constraints across gender groups for corresponding
   measurement models (see Table 3; Figure 3).

   Figure 3. Model 3.1 gm--GASA MGCFA 3 by gender, metric. Two-group
   three-factor model by gender with core items divided into NC social and
   emotional with equality constraints across gender groups for
   corresponding measurement models. Residual correlations NC social with
   NC emotional (not represenated in the path diagram) for males is 0.40
   and for females 0.87. OC, over consumption; NC, negative consequences.

   Residual correlations of NC social with NC emotional (not represented
   in the path diagram) for males was 0.40 and for females 0.87. When the
   path coefficient for OC -> NC was differentiated into a social and
   emotional path coefficient, the strongest relationship for boys
   appeared as OC -> NC social equal to 0.89 and for girls OC -> NC
   emotional equal to 0.95.

Gender Differences in the Three-Factor Model With Covariate ADHD

   When the risk factor being diagnosed with ADHD was added as a covariate
   the estimated path coefficient showed that ADHD constituted a
   significant correlate for both over consumption of gaming and negative
   consequences specified as social for females but not for males, see
   Figure 4.

   covariate. The two-group three-factor model with equality constraints
   across gender for corresponding measurement models and with covariate

   NC, negative consequences.

The Impact of Age and ADHD on Differences in Gaming Behavior for Boys and for
Girls

   The new aligned T-scores measure severity of over consumption and
   negative consequences at a common scale. Minor and non-significant
   differences appeared between the child and teenage groups concerning
   their gaming severity, both regarding over consumption and negative
   consequences, among both male and female participants. The effect of
   age is illustrated in Figure 5 and further described in ANOVA tests
   reported in Supplementary Table 8 and through descriptive statistics in
   Supplementary Table 9 in the electronic supplement. The female
   participants show a significant difference between ADHD lifetime and
   other diagnoses both for over consumption (mean 100 vs. 60, p = 0.01)
   and for negative consequences (mean 93 vs. 67, p = 0.03) while male's
   mean profiles are very close and non-significant but at a higher level
   compared with the females. The interaction effect is illustrated in
   Figure 6 and further described in ANOVA tests reported in Supplementary
   Table 5 and through descriptive statistics in Supplementary Table 6 in
   the electronic supplement.

Discussion

   The present study contributes to our understanding of the
   dimensionality of GASA but also presents results that indicate a gender
   dependent distinction regarding the negative consequences of over
   consumption of gaming. The two-factor model of the core approach showed
   a satisfactory fit to the data. The three-factor version of the core
   approach also showed a good fit, when differentiating the negative
   consequences core items into social and emotional consequences.
   Interestingly, our findings suggest that over consumption of video
   games is more heavily associated with negative consequences for male
   gamers but also that their negative consequences of over consumption
   tend to be social rather than emotional, as was the case for female
   gamers. ADHD was significantly associated with over consumption of
   video games and the negative consequences thereof for girls. The male
   participants over consumed games to a higher degree than the females
   and showed more severe consequences, regardless of a potential ADHD
   diagnosis.

   The fact that the three-factor model showed a good fit to the data
   confirms that the division of negative consequences into negative
   consequences social and negative consequences emotional could be a
   valid alternative factor structure. However, these constructs only
   contain two items each, making the social and emotional dimensions
   insufficiently grounded for reliable factor scores. Three items with
   high loadings are required to establish a solid factor (34). This
   suggests that further development of GASA is needed in order to capture
   both social and emotional components.

   Most research agree that male gender is a risk factor for disordered
   gaming (25, 27, 30). Boys in general tend to spend more time on gaming
   and they are overrepresented among the minority that exhibits gaming
   problems (27, 30). Time spent on gaming has been reported as a risk
   factor for disordered gaming (30, 40) but whether the time spent
   constitute a greater risk for boys than for girls remains unclear. Our
   findings suggest that the association between over consumption of games
   and negative consequences thereof is stronger for boys. Further, our
   results suggest that the negative consequences of over consumption take
   a social direction for boys and an emotional direction for girls, a
   distinction that warrant additional investigation. Bonnaire et al.
   investigated gender differences in disordered gaming and showed that
   male gamers were disproportionately more likely to be single than
   female gamers whereas the female gamers showed a higher anxiety score
   (31). Possibly, the results presented by Bonnaire et al. (31) supports
   the tendency shown in this study using the three-factor structure of
   GASA, illuminating gender distinctive emotional and social consequences
   of gaming. GASA could be further developed with complementary items on
   social as well as emotional aspects of gaming in order to determine and
   further explore a potential psychosocial gender discrepancy of
   disordered gaming. In the 15-item gambling Gam Test the emotional
   factor was measured with 5 items, including aspects such as; feeling
   bad when thinking about gambling, gambling resulting in feelings of
   irritation and "I do not want to tell other people about how much time
   and money I spend on my gambling" (23). Similar items, adapted to
   gaming and to young individuals, could theoretically be added to the
   GASA to strengthen the factors of both the emotional and social
   dimensions.

   ADHD is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in
   childhood with an estimated prevalence of 5 per cent, globally (41,
   42). It is a heterogeneous condition with persistent symptoms of
   hyperactivity, inattention and impulsiveness that impair functioning in
   multiple settings (1). Researchers have found that ADHD is a particular
   risk factor for disordered gaming (32, 33, 43-46). In the current CAP
   sample, ADHD was significantly associated with over consumption of
   video games and the negative consequences thereof for girls, an
   association that was not seen among the male participants. Possibly,
   our results could be interpreted as being diagnosed with ADHD increases
   the risk of over consumption of computer games and the negative
   consequences thereof more for girls than for boys. To our knowledge,
   this gender discrepancy has not previously been explored. However,
   consistent with our findings, Yen et al. showed that the association
   between ADHD and Internet addiction was greater among female than male
   college students (32). Somewhat contractionary to our findings,
   Stavropoulos et al. hypothesized that the fact that female ADHD
   predominantly demonstrates inattention while males rather experience
   hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms could contribute to a gender
   discrepancy regarding disordered gaming (29). They further hypothesized
   that hyperactivity-impulsivity mediates a greater risk for disordered
   gaming, which they managed to demonstrate, in consistency with other
   research (29, 47). However, Stavropoulos et al., did neither
   investigate whether ADHD is associated with a greater increase in risk
   for disordered gaming for either boys or girls nor did they define
   whether female gender affected the impact of
   hyperactivity-impulsivity/inattention. Martins et al., who investigated
   gender differences in mental health characteristics among adolescent
   gamblers, showed that parents to female gamblers were disproportionally
   likely to rate high levels of childhood hyperactivity when compared to
   parents to male gamblers (48). Since both gaming and gambling are more
   common and socially accepted behaviors among men, it is possible that
   women are more prone to exhibit predisposing conditions. Regardless,
   our findings warrant additional research to establish and explain a
   potential gender discrepancy regarding the association between ADHD and
   disordered gaming.

Strengths

   The study provides an interdisciplinary perspective on diagnostic
   testing and applies a psychometric methodology capable of uncovering
   different aspects of gaming behavior in a clinical setting (49).
   Specifically, the statistical analyses take measurement errors in
   criteria as well as sample size into account. Alternative measurement
   models are tested for goodness-of-fit, including test for invariance
   across gender groups (34). In summary, the methodology is grounding the
   results in qualified empirical evidence.

Limitations

   The present study does have some limitations. One limitation is the
   cross-sectional design which does not allow for conclusions regarding
   cause and effect. In order to explore causation a longitudinal
   investigation is required. Further, the measures used for this study
   are partly based on self-reporting, which implies a risk for recall
   bias. One other limitation is a possible selection bias. Clinicians
   were provided with questionnaires and were supposed to distribute them
   to their patients, but the study design does not provide any insight
   into the numbers of patients declining or more importantly why.
   However, the gender distribution was even, ADHD was the most prevalent
   disorder, as expected (41, 42) and we have no obvious reason to believe
   that the sample excelled heavily from an ordinary CAP population. The
   different specifications of alternative models relating over
   consumption with negative consequences show that the relationship is
   remarkably high, with correlations as high as 0.97, possible reflecting
   a weakness in the self-test of a strong general method factor present
   as part of both over consumption and negative consequences. Among
   issues in the design of GASA and in data collection causing bias in the
   correlation between over consumption and negative consequences through
   such a factor, is low motivation for youth to engage in answering
   questionnaires (50). Furthermore, GASA was originally developed based
   on the DSM-5 criteria for pathological gambling (15). Disordered gaming
   behavior among youth may involve other issues than those involved in
   gambling among adults.

Conclusion

   The psychometric approach differentiates information gathered using
   established diagnostic instruments like GASA into measures of behavior
   lying underneath the different markers/diagnostic criteria. Available
   diagnostic instruments could be strengthened by complementary items
   designed for children and youth in order to illuminate the complexity
   of gaming behavior. Our results suggest that the association between
   over consumption of games and negative consequences thereof is stronger
   for boys than for girls. Negative consequences of over consumption take
   a social direction for boys and an emotional direction for girls. ADHD
   was significantly associated with over consumption of video games and
   the negative consequences thereof for girls, an association that was
   not seen among the male participants. Together, our findings should
   encourage further developments of the GASA instrument and additional
   research on potential gender related discrepancies of disordered
   gaming.
