   Although they are something that many people experience when growing
   up, drinking games are far from being harmless fun. Taking part could
   mean you end up drinking a lot more than you intend, more quickly,
   increasing your risk of accidents and alcohol poisoning - which can be
   fatal.

   Read on to find out more about why drinking games can be dangerous, and
   how to stay in control.

Who plays drinking games, when and why?

   Any kind of drinking game - whether it's based on gambling, chance, a
   `forfeit' for breaking rules, or a competition - can mean people those
   taking part drink more than they want, faster than they intend. If you
   take part in one, you're giving up control over how much alcohol you
   drink - and the risks increase the more you drink.

   Drinking games are common among young adults, with peer pressure to fit
   in commonly given as a reason for taking part.

   Drinkaware research from 2019^1 found that 60% of 18-34 year-olds
   believe peer pressure to drink is common among them, with this age
   group also the most likely to say they have drunk more than they
   expected to `keep up' with others (47% said they had done this). But,
   as we're social creatures, peer pressure can affect anyone of any age.

   And if drinking games are played as part of `pre-loading' (drinking
   before going out) they are associated with higher levels of alcohol
   consumption, and greater risk.^2 Find out more on our binge drinking
   page.

Risks of drinking games

   Drinking alcohol very quickly - whether as part of a drinking game or
   not - can lead to acute alcohol poisoning, which can be extremely
   dangerous.

   There is no minimum amount of alcohol that can cause alcohol poisoning.
   It depends on a person's age, sex, size, weight, how fast they have
   been drinking, how much they have eaten, their general health and
   whether they have taken medication or drugs.

   Tragically, acute alcohol poisoning was the cause of 552 deaths in the
   UK during 2020.^3

   If you recognise the symptoms of alcohol poisoning - which include
   confusion, vomiting or seizures - call 999 immediately - you could save
   someone's life.

   Drinking alcohol impairs your judgement, balance and
   coordination^4 making it more likely you will be involved in an
   accident, with the risk increasing the more you drink.

   And the way that alcohol suppresses activity in parts of the brain
   associated with inhibition^5 means you're more likely to make a
   decision you regret, whether this means walking home alone, having
   unprotected sex, or not being able to look out for friends, drinking
   games present real dangers.

   Binge drinking increases the likelihood of both becoming aggressive or
   angry and also a victim of violence, including sexual violence and
   domestic abuse.^6

Plan ahead

   If you're worried you might be talked into a drink when you don't want
   to, plan ahead for those moments and think about what you want to say.
   Combatting peer pressure means sticking to your guns in the moment - it
   might be hard, but it's worthwhile.

   Tools to reduce your drinking

Socialise socially

   One in ten 18-34 year old drinkers say they've lost a friendship
   because of the pressure from someone - or the pressure they've put on
   someone - to drink alcohol. Speaking up might help someone else, as
   well as yourself.^7

   Beat peer pressure

Find your group

   Nearly one in six 16- to 24-year-olds in the UK (16%) say they don't
   drink at all^8 - it can be a great choice to have an active social
   life.

   How to stop drinking completely

Be kind to your future self

   Opting out of a drinking game will lower your risk of alcohol
   poisoning. It could also help you avoid a hangover, or making a
   decision you might regret - like texting an ex- or behaving in
   embarrassing ways that'll be all over social media the next morning.

   Worried you're drinking more than before?

Control your wallet

   Drinking games can be very expensive - buying huge rounds at the bar
   can rapidly burn through your money. Put the money you save towards a
   treat for yourself.

   Ideas for drink-free days

Drinking games and the UK low risk drinking guidelines

   The UK Chief Medical Officers' (CMO) low risk drinking
   guidelines recommend you should limit the total amount of alcohol you
   drink on any single occasion. You can also keep your short-term risks
   low by drinking more slowly, drinking with food, alternating any
   alcoholic drinks with water and planning ahead to avoid problems.

   Getting involved in drinking games can seriously speed up the rate you
   drink so you're more likely to exceed the guidelines.

   The long-term risks of alcohol-related health problems also mean the
   CMOs recommend that it's safest for both men and women to drink no more
   than 14 units a week, spread over three or more days with several
   drink-free days, and no bingeing.

   Following the low risk drinking guidelines and avoiding drinking games
   can help keep your risk low from accidents and injuries, physical or
   sexual abuse, alcohol poisoning and a range of long-term health
   conditions - including seven types of cancer, heart disease, high blood
   pressure, diabetes liver disease and mental health problems.
