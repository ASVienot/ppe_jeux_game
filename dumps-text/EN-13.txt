   The best legit money making apps can provide you with extra money you
   would not have otherwise just for takings surveys or playing games
   online.

   The web’s #1 top app for taking surveys, watching videos, and playing
   games for cash online is Swagbucks. It’s a well-built platform that is
   well-reviewed, and widely available for Android, iOS, and through your
   internet browser.

Overview: Best apps to make money fast

     * Best app for fast money: Swagbucks
     * Best variety of games & surveys: InboxDollars
     * Best for shopping rewards: Capital One Shopping
     * See more apps; read about the competition

Swagbucks

   People love Swagbucks because it’s a money making app that you can use
   anywhere, on your own schedule, to earn gift cards or cash rewards
   straight to your PayPal account.
   Swagbucks Swagbucks
   Swagbucks

   Swagbucks is perhaps the web’s no. 1 venue for taking surveys, watching
   videos, and playing games for cash online. The platform is well-built,
   well-reviewed, and available for Android, iOS, and through your
   internet browser.
   Offer: Get a $10 Bonus*!
   Pros:
     * Earn cashback with your daily routine
     * Multiple ways to earn
     * Free to join

   Cons:
     * May not qualify for all activities
     * Can be time consuming

   Sign Up Now
     * Where to play: Android, iOS, and swagbucks.com
     * Typical payout: ~$2–$3 per hour.
     * Cost to play: Free (most games)
     * Payout method: Gift cards via email, cash via PayPal

   Upon arriving at Swagbucks’ games hub, you’ll notice that some games
   offer cash and some offer cash back. It’s worth clarifying that if you
   play popular games like Trivial Pursuit and Bejeweled 2 through
   Swagbucks you won’t get paid, but SB will offer you a small rebate for
   cash you spend inside the games.

   In the second category, Swagbucks will actually pay you in cash or gift
   cards to play certain games. Some are recognizable, like Forge of
   Empires and Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire. Since you’re effectively
   playtesting these games for developers, Swagbucks will pay you the
   equivalent of ~$2 per hour in points, which can be redeemed once you
   earn around $5 for a gift card or money into your PayPal account.

   Swagbucks’ competitive advantage is the variety of non-game activities.
   As you accumulate points towards your next payout threshold, you can
   take a break from games and watch videos, take surveys, and more.

InboxDollars

   InboxDollars is a money making app offering surveys, videos, and of
   course, games as ways to earn a few cents to a few bucks per hour, all
   on your own schedule.
   InboxDollars InboxDollars
   InboxDollars

   InboxDollars is a free app that offers a variety of ways to make money
   fast including surveys that pay between $0.50 and $5, earning cash back
   for playing games. You can even get paid for receiving and reading
   certain emails.
   Offer: Get an instant $5 Welcome Bonus for registering today!
   Pros:
     * Earn cash, not points
     * Totally free; no risk to sign up

   Cons:
     * Not everyone will qualify for highest-paid surveys

     * Pros: Variety of games
     * Cons: Average earnings
     * Where to play: Android and inboxdollars.com
     * Typical payout: $1–$2 per hour
     * Cost to play: Free
     * Payout method: Gift cards via email, cash via PayPal

   Available as a site and Android app (the iOS app is for surveys only),
   InboxDollars makes up for below-average payout amounts with a sheer
   variety of games to play. Their extensive library includes classics
   like solitaire, mahjong, and sudoku, but also new mobile games in need
   of testing.

   If you’re already addicted to simple browser and mobile games like the
   ones listed above, InboxDollars might be a no-brainer. You won’t make a
   ton of money by only playing for an hour or two a day, but it adds up
   fast.

   Plus, if you tire of games, you can also switch over to watching videos
   or survey-taking as ways to accumulate InboxDollars on your way to
   their $30 minimum threshold. It’ll take a while, but at least you’ll
   have plenty of ways to get there. Enjoy a $5 sign up bonus when you
   enroll.

The competition

   Here are some more of the best money making apps we recommend that just
   didn’t make our top three. All of these apps are legit and can save
   money or make money with relatively little effort. These other apps pay
   either in PayPal cash, free gift card or, in a few cases, direct
   deposit to. your bank account.

Mistplay

   Mistplay pays you to play new Android games and provides developers
   with feedback based upon your experience. Each 2- to 10-minute gaming
   session can reward the cash equivalent of $0.66.
     * Pros: Curates based upon your gaming preferences
     * Cons: Only available on Android
     * Where to play: Android
     * Typical payout: $2–$5 per hour
     * Cost to play: Free
     * Payout method: Gift cards via email (within 48 hours), including
       Visa, Amazon, Steam, and more

   Mistplay pays out a little above average, and I admire the platform for
   being both developer- and user-friendly. First, to benefit developers
   who test their games through Mistplay, the app accelerates cash
   earnings the longer you test a game, so you’re incentivized to play
   longer and provide better feedback to its creators. Second, Mistplay
   offers users a feature called the “Mix” whereby it’ll generate a
   playlist of gaming experiences based upon your genre preferences
   (puzzle, platforming, action, etc.).

   In total, Mistplay is a great place for gamers to test new games and
   help out developers while earning a trickle of cash for their efforts.
   As far as games-for-cash sites go, Mistplay seems among the most
   wholesome and well-intentioned.

   » Sign Up for Mistplay.

   We investigated around three dozen popular games-for-cash sites. These
   don’t make our top picks but still stood out as great options to
   consider.

Truist Long Game

   Truist Long Game is best described as a gamified savings account. When
   you make a deposit into your Long Game account, whether automatic or
   manual, Long Game will reward you for saving by giving you coins that
   you can use to play games.
     * Pros: Can incentivize more saving, potential jackpots can offset
       lower APY
     * Cons: Low base APY may apply
     * Where to play: Android and iOS
     * Typical payout: APY plus jackpots ranging from $100 to $1,000,000
     * Cost to play: Free for 30 days, then $3 monthly (waived if you set
       up automatic savings)
     * Payout method: Direct deposit into savings

   Founded by a California-based Millennial looking to inspire young
   people to save, Long Game offers a free 30-day trial and stays free as
   long as you use direct deposit. What’s also nice is that all of your
   money is FDIC-insured.

   Long Game might be a good fit if the lure of getting more coins to play
   games incentivizes you to save more in the long run.

Rakuten

   You won’t get paid $2 an hour to play Angry Birds 2 with Rakuten — but
   several folks told me they switched from gaming apps to Rakuten because
   the savings outweighed the income generation from gaming.
     * Pros: Constantly changing deals to suit your shopping tastes
     * Cons: May tempt you to spend money
     * Where to play: Android and iOS
     * Typical payout: Up to 10% off at over 3,500 retailers
     * Cost to play: Free
     * Payout method: Delayed cash back on purchases

   And to Rakuten’s credit, the app does kinda “gamify” shopping.

   Here’s how Rakuten (Japanese for “optimism”) works. If you’re on the
   way to the store, instead of a gaming app, crack open Rakuten and see
   what exclusive deals the retailer is currently offering through
   Rakuten. Link the credit card you’re about to use at the register,
   swipe it to pay, and Rakuten automatically registers that you’ve earned
   the reward.

   In total, Rakuten claims to have saved shoppers over $3.5 billion in
   cash back from over 3,500 retailers. And the deals constantly change
   with the tide, which makes it kinda fun.

   Just be careful not to let Rakuten convince you to spend money you’d
   otherwise be saving!

Survey Junkie

   Survey Junkie is a long-established free app that helps you make money
   and earn rewards while taking online surveys on your own hours. Earning
   money with Survey Junkie is as easy as signing up, completing your
   profile, and then completing market research surveys that come your
   way.

   How much you can earn with Survey Junkie really depends on the number
   of market research online surveys you’re selected for. It’s not passive
   income, but it’s another easy way to pick up some extra cash.

Google Opinion Rewards

   Yep, the Google. They have a paid survey app and, as you can imagine,
   it’s pretty well-made. It’s a top choice if you’re looking to get paid
   to share your thoughts.
     * Pros: Positive reviews and stable app
     * Cons: Sometimes limited surveys
     * Where to play: Android and iOS
     * Typical payout: $4–$5 per hour (when surveys are available)
     * Cost to play: Free
     * Payout method: PayPal or Play Store credit

   Here’s how Google describes it. “Complete short surveys while standing
   in line, or waiting for a subway. Get rewarded with Google Play or
   PayPal credit for each one you complete.”

   The app maintains a 4.7 out of 5 stars in the Play Store and the
   positive reviews seem legit. Folks complain about the occasional
   shortage of surveys to take, sure, but they still seem to earn enough
   cash overall to cover one premium subscription each month (e.g.,
   YouTube Premium for $11.99).

   The app deserves kudos for overall stability, too, since paid survey
   apps tend to crash frequently and cause frustration.

Other money making apps to avoid

   Honorable mention to some other great free apps out there that may
   branch out the realm of earning with surveys and games. These include
   Survey Junkie, Ibotta, Fiverr, Upwork, and OfferUp. They’re worth
   checking out.

   Here, though, are three that aren’t. Out of the dozens of apps I
   investigated, I’m shining a spotlight on this ignominious trifecta
   because their shadiness was the most well-hidden. These three sites and
   apps appear legit at first, but there’s something more mischievous,
   even sinister underneath their facades.

Bananatic

   No single violation disqualified Bananatic from this list. Rather, it
   was more of a “death by 1,000 cuts” situation, since everywhere I
   looked I got an uneasy vibe from this site.

   Everything about Bananatic looks legit at first glance. According to
   Similar Web, the site has over a quarter-million visitors per month
   plus a similar number of Likes on Facebook, and the BananApp (as it’s
   called) received plenty of five-star reviews on the Play Store. Plus,
   the site itself looks pretty legit and well-designed, almost like a
   rival to Steam.

   However, the plot thickens as I pulled back the curtain. Despite having
   256,000 Facebook Likes, nobody engages with their content, posted at
   precisely 9 AM every four days. Many of their five-star reviews on the
   Play Store sound fake, and when a real human publishes a legit one-star
   review, Bananatic responds “Please change or delete your opinion.”

Givling

   Givling was the last games-for-cash site to be ejected from my final
   list. It wasn’t easy, because I cheered for Givling. I wanted the app
   to be as good as it sounded.

   See, the problem with Givling is that you can’t just log in tomorrow,
   win the week’s trivia, and receive the jackpot. Everything you do in
   Givling raises your place in the “queue,” and whoever’s at the top of
   the queue every two weeks gets the jackpot.

   You can rise up the queue by watching ads and playing games, but also
   by buying products from Givling’s sponsors and simply handing the app
   money.

   Do you see the problem? You essentially have to “bid” your way to the
   top, which explains why one woman had to spend $42,000 to win $50,000
   (and countless players spend thousands for nothing).

   Inevitably, in 2019 Givling got blasted by CNBC for manipulating and
   frisking players who were simply desperate to pay off their student
   loans. A Minnesota state legislator called it “gambling” while watchdog
   group Pyramid Scheme Alert called it “a sophisticated scheme.”

Lucky Day

   Lucky Day was endorsed by so many “Top 10 Games-For-Cash Sites”
   listicles that I assumed it must have some air of legitimacy.
   Furthermore, it offered a simple, seemingly incorruptible premise: play
   free virtual scratch-offs, maybe win some cash.

   Even still, the app had a rather nasty trick up its sleeve, one that I
   alluded to earlier.

   Lucky Day has a payout threshold of $10. When you collect enough
   points, you’re supposed to head to the in-app marketplace to exchange
   your points for a gift card. However, users are reporting that once
   they reach about $9.90 worth of points, they never seem to win the last
   $0.10 despite weeks, months, even years of attempts.

   Once you approach the threshold, the app pushes paid “upgrades” that
   supposedly increase your chances of earning those final $0.10 so you
   can finally cash out. Users spend $1, $3, then $5 on upgrades but still
   don’t win the final $0.10.

Tip

Most games-for-cash sites are a waste of time at best and can fleece you out of
thousands at worst. If you’re really interested in experimenting with this type
of website, you’ll find safer havens in the options that I’ve highlighted.

How we came up with this list

   To create this list I investigated about three dozen of the most
   popular games-for-cash sites and apps. I graded each using a rubric
   combining multiple factors:
     * Legitimacy — Is the app what it claims to be, or is it stealing
       data?
     * Usability — Does the app work and is it regularly updated and
       supported?
     * User reviews — Is the quality and legitimacy of the app verified by
       real user reviews?
     * Cash payout — Do users report actually receiving cash or free gift
       cards from the app?
     * Variety and quality of games — Quite simply, are the games fun and
       varied?

   To my surprise, even some of the most popular games-for-cash apps
   failed stupendously in two of the most critical metrics: user reviews
   and cash payout.

   Many games-for-cash apps have glowing App Store reviews that are
   clearly fake and paid for. This really bothers me, because it means
   that rather than listen to their critical user feedback, developers
   chose instead to spend resources drowning them out so they could lure
   more users into broken apps. Fake review scores mean a developer
   doesn’t care and neither should you.

   Next, some of the more popular games-for-cash apps have developed an
   insidious scheme whereby they cut off earnings just short of their
   payout threshold. For example, one app has a $10 minimum payout amount,
   which sounds easy to reach, but right as users approached $9.85 in
   credit, earning opportunities mysteriously dried up.

   As a result, users stuck in a sunk-cost fallacy would continue to log
   in for weeks and months, digging through ads for opportunities that
   didn’t exist. Basically, the app had duped them into hours of free
   labor, and naturally, had no place on this list.

Who the best apps to make money are for

   These apps for are people looking to make extra income and earn rewards
   by completing activities they would have anyway while earning cashback
   or branching out with surveys and games. They’re not for people looking
   to generate life-changing amounts of money.

How to spot a sketchy paid gaming app

   Now that we’ve covered some legit and less-legit cash-generating apps,
   what red flags should you watch out for to separate the two?

   Let’s use the weirdest, sketchiest one I came across as an ignominious
   example: Coin Pop.

   For starters, Coin Pop is an Android-only app, not to be mistaken for
   COIN POP — Covered in Kitties listed on the App Store.

   Anyways, despite having the less interesting name of the two, Coin Pop
   for Android is one quirky gaming app. On the surface it’s pretty
   standard stuff: play games, reach “levels,” convert level bonuses to
   cash.

   But things get weird from there.

   First, once you register, Coin Pop will ask your age and gender so it
   can offer you a preselected list of what it thinks are age- and
   gender-specific games (Coin Pop isn’t gunning for Politically Correct
   App of the Year).

   Then, Coin Pop will prompt you to download games you’d like to play
   individually. This can take up some serious space on your hard drive,
   and since the ROI on certain games tends to drop off a cliff after a
   few sessions, you’re encouraged to keep downloading new games
   constantly and sucking up your data.

   Worse still, the app used to let you cash out as little as $0.50 worth
   of earnings, and securely via PayPal, no less.

   But now, Coin Pop has moved the goalpost to $35 — and even the most
   dedicated users report it being impossible to get there. Multiple users
   have reported getting super close, only to be logged out and unable to
   log back in.

   But I love Coin Pop because it’s a one-stop-shop for every red flag in
   the paid gaming space. A jack-of-all-trades of shadiness, if you will.

   Those red flags are:
     * Requires a concerning amount of personal data upfront (e.g., facial
       ID)
     * Uses too much mobile data
     * Appears to be “abandonware” with little to no developer support
     * A confusing rewards system
     * A manipulative and unreachable cashing out threshold
     * Overwhelmingly negative app reviews
     * A disconnect between anonymous rating scores and published review
       scores
     * Doesn’t tell you when you’re not earning cash to trick you into
       playing “for free”

   Here are some other paid gaming apps that raised at least two of these
   red flags:
     * Poll Pay
     * App Flame
     * Money Well
     * Bingo Clash
     * Match2Win
     * CashAlarm
     * Money RAWR
     * Cashyy

   Can the developers turn these apps around? Possibly. But for now, I
   subjectively think they’re a waste of time.

Why do game apps let you play for money?

   When you play games through apps like Swagbucks, Mistplay, or
   InboxDollars, they’re paying you because you’re watching ads or testing
   games for their clients, the developers.

   In essence, you’re every child’s dream: a paid video game tester. Even
   if you’re not directly providing feedback via surveys, the developers
   are collecting background data like how long it took you to complete a
   certain quest, where you got lost, which items you used, etc. This is
   incredibly valuable data to mobile game developers, especially since
   they’re competing to make the most playable and addictive game
   possible.

How much money can you make playing games online?

   Payouts from games-for-cash sites and apps can range from a few cents
   per hour to an entire $50,000 jackpot.

   On average, you can consistently make around $2 per hour playing games
   online.

   Overall, games-for-cash sites aren’t much of an income generator, so I
   don’t recommend that you play them for the money. Instead, play them
   for fun and enjoy the trickle of cash as a side bonus.

Is my personal information safe on these websites?

   Sharing your name, email, and phone number online is never totally
   risk-free, but generally speaking, you’ll be OK sharing the bare
   essentials on these sites.

   In some cases, these sites may redirect you to third-party apps or
   games. If so, follow these tips to protect your personal information,
   and don’t hesitate to back out if you feel uncomfortable:
     * Add your phone number to the Do Not Call Registry
     * Use an alternative email address
     * Give a fake phone number (XXX-555-XXXX)
     * Use your last initial instead of your full name
     * Never give possible answers to “secret questions” i.e., name of
       childhood best friend

Summary: Best apps to make money fast

   “Play games for cash” sounds too good to be true, and it mostly is. The
   majority of games-for-cash sites are junk, luring users in with fake
   review scores and teasing them with cash payouts that will never come.

   However, there are at least six that are honest and well-intentioned,
   including our top pick, Swagbucks. These apps can be good options that
   pay money and are honest, legitimate, and maybe even worthy of your
   time.

   For a list of apps that may be less fun upfront, but will help you save
   life-changing money, check out our list of the Best Budgeting Apps.
