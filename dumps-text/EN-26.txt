   Whether it's a holiday or a big family meal, everyone has their
   favorite traditional dishes. But even the most beloved main dishes can
   become a little tired. We have a suggestion for making your meals a
   little different and possibly even more delicious: Bring game meat to
   your dining room table.

   In addition to lamb, beef, pork, and poultry, numerous meat-centric
   wholesalers and retailers around the country also offer wild and
   farm-raised game meats. Game meats are usually categorized as the
   following:
     * Winged game, such as quail, duck, and pheasant.
     * Ground game, such as hare and rabbit.
     * Big game, such as bison, venison, elk, and wild boar.

   They're not only interesting from a culinary perspective but are
   uniquely sustainable proteins. Game meats are primarily raised on
   pasture, which is better for the planet, requiring fewer natural
   resources to raise. They provide lean, high-quality, nutrient-rich
   protein that's free of antibiotics and adds much-needed diversity to
   our diets.

   This feature highlights some of our favorite game meats and how they
   can be used as alternatives to the common center-of-the-plate proteins
   such as poultry, pork, and beef.
   The Best Places to Order Meat Online for Convenient Deliveries

Instead of Poultry, Try...

Pheasant

   Pheasant is one of the most approachable game birds, perfect for those
   new to the world of game meats. Similar to the size of a chicken, a
   whole pheasant averages about 2 to 3 pounds. It has lean meat that is
   full of flavor, making it a great alternative to chicken and
   turkey. Its smaller size is perfect for smaller holiday celebrations or
   meals, when preparing a whole turkey may seem like overkill, but you
   want something more celebratory and special than chicken. Pheasant also
   makes incredible sausage, the perfect complement to traditional
   stuffing in place of traditional Italian sausage.

   How to Prepare

   Roast it whole or prepare the breast and legs separately. Because it is
   a lean meat, moisture needs to be added to the cooking process--it is
   prepared best using low heat to prevent it from drying out. For
   example, if oven or pan roasting (both dry heat methods), rub the bird
   with butter or oil and baste while roasting, similar to a whole turkey
   or pan-roasted chicken breasts. Alternatively, pheasant can be prepared
   in a quick braise, adding more moisture to the meat from the braising
   liquid.

   Flavor Pairings

   Go with fruits such as apple, oranges, and prunes, sweet cooking wine
   or liquor like port or cognac, and fall spices and aromatics, such as
   sage and thyme.

Squab

   Smaller than pheasant and often called a young pigeon, squab is a game
   bird usually only about 1 pound or less in size. Unlike pheasant, its
   meat throughout is a red dark meat (similar to duck or dark meat
   turkey), slightly gamy in flavor, and incredibly tender and delicious.
   One whole roasted bird is just right for a single-serving entrée, or
   several can be prepared for a small holiday feast.

   How to Prepare

   Squab is best prepared medium-rare to medium, similar to other red
   meats, and can be prepared in a variety of ways, including roasted, pan
   roasted, or grilled. There is only a small amount of meat in the legs
   (most is in the breasts), and because of its small size, it is
   typically prepared as a whole bird. Brushing with fat before grilling
   or basting while roasting is recommended to help prevent the lean meat
   from becoming dry, particularly if you are preparing it more
   well-done.

   Flavor Pairings

   Fruit such as pears, apples, grapes, figs, and prunes; sweet vinegars
   such as balsamic vinegar or fig vinegar; and tender root vegetables
   such as baby turnips, beets, and carrots all pair nicely with squab.

Quail

   As the smallest of the game birds on this list, quail is another great
   substitute for poultry. Its meat looks very similar to chicken but more
   intense and pronounced in flavor. Typically weighing just 4 to 6
   ounces, one whole quail is just the right size for an appetizer or
   small entrée. Quail would also be perfect served family style among
   other plentiful sides. There are different breeds of quail, all
   relatively the same size with the exception of the Jumbo Brown Coturnix
   Quail, which is known for its meatiness compared to other breeds as it
   is nearly double the size of an average quail.

   How to Prepare

   Quail can be purchased whole or semi-boneless--both ideal for stuffing
   and roasting--resulting in a beautiful presentation. Whole quail can
   also be flavored with a short marinade and then spatchcocked and
   grilled, oven roasted, and even fried, while quail breasts or legs can
   be simply pan roasted.

   Like other game birds, the meat is lean. While it should be cooked
   through until juices run clear, it cooks very quickly and can become
   dry if overcooked; basting or brushing with fat will help retain
   moisture. Because of their small size, quail is one of the easiest and
   fastest game birds to prepare, and it is also incredibly versatile.

   Flavor Pairings

   Opt for winter citrus, grapes, tart dried fruit such as cranberries or
   goji berries, pomegranate; sweet cooking wine or liquor like port,
   sherry, or cognac; BBQ flavors, fall spices, cumin, coriander, honey,
   or maple.

Instead of Beef, Try...

Bison

   For someone new to game meat, one of the easiest ways to get an
   introduction is by substituting a favorite beef dish with
   bison. Although very similar to cattle in its nature, farmed bison does
   not come with the same concerns around antibiotics (they're not
   routinely used); is a nutritious, sustainable substitute for beef
   (particularly when 100 percent grass fed); and has a unique earthy
   flavor with a subtly sweet finish that may convert you for good.

   Bison steaks, tenderloin, short ribs, stew meat, and ground meat are
   all ideal for swapping in place of beef. At the holiday table, bison
   can take its place center stage in the form of a roast, stew, braise,
   or delicious grilled steak. Or it can be incorporated into elegant hors
   d'oeuvres--for example, braised bison short rib crostini or bison
   carpaccio.

   How to Prepare

   Bison should be prepared similarly to beef with different cooking
   methods according to the cut. It can be used ground or in whole cuts,
   which can be grilled, braised, and more.

   Flavor Pairings

   Use earthy flavors such as mushrooms, root vegetables such as beets,
   turnips, parsnips, carrots, and rutabaga; caramelized onion and roasted
   garlic; savory herbs and spices such as rosemary, thyme, and black
   pepper, as well as parsley and cilantro.

Venison

   Perhaps one of the more familiar game meats, venison refers to the meat
   from deer. Although hunting for deer is legal in certain areas and at
   certain times of the year, the venison available for purchase from
   commercial retailers is farm raised on commercial ranches.
   Historically, venison was known for its strong gamy flavor, but the
   venison from farm-raised animals is much less gamy than the meat from
   hunted animals due to their consistent diet. Its iron-rich red meat can
   be prepared in a variety of ways similar to beef and is extremely
   versatile. Unlike beef, it does not have fat marbled throughout and is
   extremely lean, which is important to keep in mind when preparing since
   it can get tough if overcooked.

   How to Prepare

   Venison is the perfect special occasion meat for a table centerpiece
   and nearly every cut of venison can be used as a swap for beef. For
   real holiday showstoppers, replace beef with venison in celebratory
   dishes like beef Wellington or osso buco or even a straightforward
   venison strip loin or roast in place of beef tenderloin or pot roast.
   For something more rustic, use venison stew meat and make a hunter's
   stew. Or use ground venison in a traditional meat pie. Note: Elk is
   often described interchangeably with venison; while they are not the
   same animal, they are both in the deer family, and elk can be used in
   place of venison in any recipe due to its similarities.

   Flavor Pairings

   Fruits including blueberries, cherries, cranberries, pomegranate, and
   dates; hearty vegetables including winter squash and root vegetables as
   well as mushrooms; aromatics such as savory, thyme, sage, juniper
   berries, black pepper, and even cocoa powder all pair nicely with
   venison.

Instead of Pork, Try...

Wild Boar

   One of the wildest of the game meats, wild boar is one of the oldest
   species in existence, dating back to before the Ice Age. Native wild
   boar is found in various regions throughout the world and has been a
   predominant part of numerous global cuisines. In the U.S., the majority
   of wild boar is pasture raised, although some are still humanely
   trapped in the wild. Although it is an ancestor of the pig, its meat is
   much leaner and darker than pork and has a much sweeter flavor due to
   its wild diet of acorns, nuts, and natural forage.

   How to Prepare

   Similar to other game meats, wild boar is best cooked gently over low
   heat and, if using a dry heat method, not overcooked. Instead of a
   crown pork roast, make a crown wild boar rack. Instead of Christmas
   ham, try wild boar shoulder roast. Instead of pork tenderloin? You
   guessed it, swap with wild boar tenderloin. And for smaller gatherings,
   look for a wild boar mini roast that will feed three to four people,
   making it perfect for a meal for two (plus some bonus
   leftovers). Similar to venison and bison, wild boar can also be used in
   winter stews--opt for braising cuts like shoulder or stew meat for this
   preparation and cook low and slow.

   Flavor Pairings

   Ingredients with robust flavors, such as cooked tomatoes, mushrooms,
   onions, root vegetables, red wine, and aromatics such as rosemary,
   sage, and thyme are all-natural pairings for wild boar.

Where to Buy

   Game meat can sometimes be found at meat counters and specialty
   butchers. Check with your local farmers market as well. There are a
   variety of retailers selling game meats online that offer nationwide
   delivery.
