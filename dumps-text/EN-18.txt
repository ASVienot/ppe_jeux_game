   Forms of competitive activity, usually physical
   For other uses, see Sport (disambiguation).

   [300px-Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg] Sport in childhood. Association
   football, shown above, is a team sport which also provides
   opportunities to nurture physical fitness and social interaction
   skills.[220px-London_Marathon_2005_at_Blackfriars.jpg] The 2005 London
   Marathon: running races, in their various specialties, represent the
   oldest and most traditional form of sport.

   Sport pertains to any form of physical activity or game,^[1] often
   competitive and organized, that aims to use, maintain, or improve
   physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants
   and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators.^[2] Sports can,
   through casual or organized participation, improve participants'
   physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single
   contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous
   participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain
   sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or
   consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is
   between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports
   allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others
   provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner. A number of contests
   may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports
   leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports
   season, followed in some cases by playoffs.

   Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical
   athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions such as the
   Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition.^[3] Other
   organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities
   without a physical element from classification as sports.^[2] However,
   a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition
   as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF)
   recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord,
   the international sports federation association, recognises five
   non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and
   xiangqi,^[4]^[5] and limits the number of mind games which can be
   admitted as sports.^[1]

   Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to
   ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the
   winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring
   goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who
   are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective
   or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic
   impression.

   Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this
   information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is
   also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with
   spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching
   wider audiences through broadcasting. Sport betting is in some cases
   severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.

   According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry
   is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013.^[6] The world's most accessible
   and practised sport is running, while association football is the most
   popular spectator sport.^[7]

Meaning and usage

Etymology

   The word "sport" comes from the Old French desport meaning "leisure",
   with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being "anything
   humans find amusing or entertaining".^[8]

   Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of
   gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that
   require exercise.^[9] Roget's defines the noun sport as an "activity
   engaged in for relaxation and amusement" with synonyms including
   diversion and recreation.^[10]

Nomenclature

   The singular term "sport" is used in most English dialects to describe
   the overall concept (e.g. "children taking part in sport"), with
   "sports" used to describe multiple activities (e.g. "football and rugby
   are the most popular sports in England"). American English uses
   "sports" for both terms.

Definition

   See also: Game § Definitions
   [200px-ChessStartingPosition.jpg] The International Olympic Committee
   recognises some board games as sports, including
   chess.[200px-Showjumping_white_horse.jpg] Show jumping, an equestrian
   sport

   The precise definition of what differentiates a sport from other
   leisure activities varies between sources. The closest to an
   international agreement on a definition is provided by the Global
   Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF), which is the
   association for all the largest international sports federations
   (including association football, athletics, cycling, tennis, equestrian
   sports, and more), and is therefore the de facto representative of
   international sport.

   GAISF uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:^[1]
     * have an element of competition
     * be in no way harmful to any living creature
     * not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding
       proprietary games such as arena football)
     * not rely on any "luck" element specifically designed into the
       sport.

   They also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as rugby
   or athletics), primarily mind (such as chess or Go), predominantly
   motorised (such as Formula 1 or powerboating), primarily co-ordination
   (such as billiard sports), or primarily animal-supported (such as
   equestrian sport).^[1]

   The inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been
   universally accepted, leading to legal challenges from governing bodies
   in regards to being denied funding available to sports.^[11] Whilst
   GAISF recognises a small number of mind sports, it is not open to
   admitting any further mind sports.

   There has been an increase in the application of the term "sport" to a
   wider set of non-physical challenges such as video games, also called
   esports (from "electronic sports"), especially due to the large scale
   of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely
   recognised by mainstream sports organisations. According to Council of
   Europe, European Sports Charter, article 2.i, "'Sport' means all forms
   of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation,
   aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being,
   forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all
   levels."^[12]

Competition

   [220px-Horse-racing-4.jpg] Horse racing

   There are opposing views on the necessity of competition as a defining
   element of a sport, with almost all professional sports involving
   competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a
   prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee
   (IOC) or GAISF.^[1]

   Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all
   physical activity. For instance, the Council of Europe include all
   forms of physical exercise, including those competed just for fun.

   In order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on
   less able participants, there has been an introduction of
   non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events
   such as school sports days, although moves like this are often
   controversial.^[13]^[14]

   In competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on
   their "result" and often divided into groups of comparable performance,
   (e.g. gender, weight and age). The measurement of the result may be
   objective or subjective, and corrected with "handicaps" or penalties.
   In a race, for example, the time to complete the course is an objective
   measurement. In gymnastics or diving the result is decided by a panel
   of judges, and therefore subjective. There are many shades of judging
   between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by
   judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time.

   Artifacts and structures suggest sport in China as early as 2000
   BC.^[15] Gymnastics appears to have been popular in China's ancient
   past. Monuments to the Pharaohs indicate that a number of sports,
   including swimming and fishing, were well-developed and regulated
   several thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt.^[16] Other Egyptian
   sports included javelin throwing, high jump, and wrestling. Ancient
   Persian sports such as the traditional Iranian martial art of
   Zoorkhaneh had a close connection to warfare skills.^[17] Among other
   sports that originated in ancient Persia are polo and jousting. The
   traditional South Asian sport of kabaddi has been played for thousands
   of years, potentially as a preparation for hunting.^[18]
   [200px-Bruno_Senna_2006_Australian_Grand_Prix.jpg] Motorised sports
   have appeared since the advent of the modern age.

   A wide range of sports were already established by the time of Ancient
   Greece and the military culture and the development of sport in Greece
   influenced one another considerably. Sport became such a prominent part
   of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in
   ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the
   Peloponnesus called Olympia.^[19]

   Sports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of
   the ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialisation has
   brought motorised transportation and increased leisure time, letting
   people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic
   activities. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and
   global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding
   to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans followed the
   exploits of professional athletes – all while enjoying the exercise and
   competition associated with amateur participation in sports. Since the
   turn of the 21st century, there has been increasing debate about
   whether transgender sports people should be able to participate in
   sport events that conform with their post-transition gender
   identity.^[20]

Fair play

Sportsmanship

   Main article: Sportsmanship
   See also: Gamesmanship and Winning isn't everything; it's the only
   thing

   Sportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy
   toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and
   grace in victory or defeat.^[21]^[22]^[23]

   Sportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will
   be enjoyed for its own sake. The well-known sentiment by sports
   journalist Grantland Rice, that it is "not that you won or lost but how
   you played the game", and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its
   founder Pierre de Coubertin: "The most important thing... is not
   winning but taking part" are typical expressions of this sentiment.

Cheating

   See also: Match fixing and cheating

   Key principles of sport include that the result should not be
   predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to
   win. Rules are in place to ensure fair play, but participants can break
   these rules in order to gain advantage.

   Participants may cheat in order to unfairly increase their chance of
   winning, or in order to achieve other advantages such as financial
   gains. The widespread existence of gambling on the results of sports
   events creates a motivation for match fixing, where a participant or
   participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome rather than
   simply playing to win.

Doping and drugs

   Main article: Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport

   The competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt
   to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through
   other means such as increasing the volume of blood in their bodies
   through artificial means.

   All sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to
   implement a testing programme, looking for a list of banned drugs, with
   suspensions or bans being placed on participants who test positive for
   banned substances.

  Violence

   Violence in sports involves crossing the line between fair competition
   and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, fans, and
   parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in
   misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration. Rioting
   or hooliganism by fans in particular is a problem at some national and
   international sporting contests.^[citation needed]

Participation

  Gender participation

   [220px-100_metres_race_winner_Sina_Schielke_%28192%29_and_the_other_Run
   ners_-_ISTAF_2006_-_Berlin%2C_3_September.jpg] International level
   female athletes at ISTAF Berlin, 2006

   Female participation in sports continues to rise alongside the
   opportunity for involvement and the value of sports for child
   development and physical fitness. Despite increases in female
   participation during the last three decades, a gap persists in the
   enrolment figures between male and female players in sports-related
   teams. Female players account for 39% of the total participation in US
   interscholastic athletics.

   Certain sports are mixed-gender, allowing (or even requiring) men and
   women to play on the same team. One example of this is Baseball5, which
   is the first mixed-gender sport to have been admitted into an Olympic
   event.^[24]

  Youth participation

   See also: College sports

   Youth sport presents children with opportunities for fun,
   socialisation, forming peer relationships, physical fitness, and
   athletic scholarships. Activists for education and the war on drugs
   encourage youth sport as a means to increase educational participation
   and to fight the illegal drug trade. According to the Center for Injury
   Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital, the biggest risk
   for youth sport is death or serious injury including concussion. These
   risks come from running, basketball, association football, volleyball,
   gridiron, gymnastics, and ice hockey.^[25] Youth sport in the US is a
   $15 billion industry including equipment up to private coaching.^[26]

  Disabled participation

   See also: Parasports

   [220px-David_Bizet_-_Marathon_de_Paris_2014.jpg] A runner gives a
   friendly tap on the shoulder to a wheelchair racer during the Marathon
   International de Paris (Paris Marathon) in 2014.

   Disabled sports also adaptive sports or parasports, are sports played
   by people with a disability, including physical and intellectual
   disabilities. As many of these are based on existing sports modified to
   meet the needs of people with a disability, they are sometimes referred
   to as adapted sports. However, not all disabled sports are adapted;
   several sports that have been specifically created for people with a
   disability have no equivalent in able-bodied sports.

  Spectator involvement

   Main article: Spectator sport

   [220px-1906_Athens_stadium.jpg] Spectators at the 1906 unofficial
   Olympic Games

   The competition element of sport, along with the aesthetic appeal of
   some sports, result in the popularity of people attending to watch
   sport being played. This has led to the specific phenomenon of
   spectator sport.

   Both amateur and professional sports attract spectators, both in person
   at the sport venue, and through broadcast media including radio,
   television and internet broadcast. Both attendance in person and
   viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge, such as an
   entrance ticket, or pay-per-view television broadcast. Sports league
   and tournament are two common arrangements to organise sport teams or
   individual athletes into competing against each other continuously or
   periodically.

   It is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences,
   leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the
   rights to show certain events. The football World Cup attracts a global
   television audience of hundreds of millions; the 2006 final alone
   attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700 million and
   the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final attracted an estimated audience of
   135 million in India alone.^[27]

   In the United States, the championship game of the NFL, the Super Bowl,
   has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the
   year.^[28]^[29] Super Bowl Sunday is a de facto national holiday in
   America;^[30]^[31] the viewership being so great that in 2015,
   advertising space was reported as being sold at $4.5m for a 30-second
   slot.^[28]

Amateur and professional

   See also: Professional sport and Amateur sport

   [220px-Volleyball-5_%289786053885%29.jpg] Women's volleyball team of a
   U.S. university

   Sport can be undertaken on an amateur, professional or
   semi-professional basis, depending on whether participants are
   incentivised for participation (usually through payment of a wage or
   salary). Amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called
   "grassroots sport".^[2]^[32]

   The popularity of spectator sport as a recreation for non-participants
   has led to sport becoming a major business in its own right, and this
   has incentivised a high paying professional sport culture, where high
   performing participants are rewarded with pay far in excess of average
   wages, which can run into millions of dollars.^[33]

   Some sports, or individual competitions within a sport, retain a policy
   of allowing only amateur sport. The Olympic Games started with a
   principle of amateur competition with those who practised a sport
   professionally considered to have an unfair advantage over those who
   practised it merely as a hobby.^[34] From 1971, Olympic athletes were
   allowed to receive compensation and sponsorship,^[35] and from 1986,
   the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the
   Olympics,^[35]^[36] with the exceptions of boxing,^[37]^[38] and
   wrestling.^[39]^[40]

   Technology plays an important part in modern sport. It is a necessary
   part of some sports (such as motorsport), and it is used in others to
   improve performance. Some sports also use it to allow off-field
   decision making.

   Sports science is a widespread academic discipline, and can be applied
   to areas including athlete performance, such as the use of video
   analysis to fine-tune technique, or to equipment, such as improved
   running shoes or competitive swimwear. Sports engineering emerged as a
   discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not just on materials
   design but also the use of technology in sport, from analytics and big
   data to wearable technology.^[41] In order to control the impact of
   technology on fair play, governing bodies frequently have specific
   rules that are set to control the impact of technical advantage between
   participants. For example, in 2010, full-body, non-textile swimsuits
   were banned by FINA, as they were enhancing swimmers'
   performances.^[42]^[43]

   The increase in technology has also allowed many decisions in sports
   matches to be taken, or reviewed, off-field, with another official
   using instant replays to make decisions. In some sports, players can
   now challenge decisions made by officials. In Association football,
   goal-line technology makes decisions on whether a ball has crossed the
   goal line or not.^[44] The technology is not compulsory,^[45] but was
   used in the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil,^[46] and the 2015 FIFA
   Women's World Cup in Canada,^[47] as well as in the Premier League from
   2013–14,^[48] and the Bundesliga from 2015–16.^[49] In the NFL, a
   referee can ask for a review from the replay booth, or a head coach can
   issue a challenge to review the play using replays. The final decision
   rests with the referee.^[50] A video referee (commonly known as a
   Television Match Official or TMO) can also use replays to help
   decision-making in rugby (both league and union).^[51]^[52] In
   international cricket, an umpire can ask the Third umpire for a
   decision, and the third umpire makes the final decision.^[53]^[54]
   Since 2008, a decision review system for players to review decisions
   has been introduced and used in ICC-run tournaments, and optionally in
   other matches.^[53]^[55] Depending on the host broadcaster, a number of
   different technologies are used during an umpire or player review,
   including instant replays, Hawk-Eye, Hot Spot and Real Time
   Snickometer.^[56]^[57] Hawk-Eye is also used in tennis to challenge
   umpiring decisions.^[58]^[59]

Sports and education

   Research suggests that sports have the capacity to connect youth to
   positive adult role models and provide positive development
   opportunities, as well as promote the learning and application of life
   skills.^[60]^[61] In recent years the use of sport to reduce crime, as
   well as to prevent violent extremism and radicalization, has become
   more widespread, especially as a tool to improve self-esteem, enhance
   social bonds and provide participants with a feeling of purpose.^[61]

   There is no high-quality evidence that shows the effectiveness of
   interventions to increase sports participation of the community in
   sports such as mass media campaigns, educational sessions, and policy
   changes.^[62] There is also no high-quality studies that investigate
   the effect of such interventions in promoting healthy behaviour change
   in the community.^[63]

Politics

   Main article: Politics and sports

   Benito Mussolini used the 1934 FIFA World Cup, which was held in Italy,
   to showcase Fascist Italy.^[64]^[65] Adolf Hitler also used the 1936
   Summer Olympics held in Berlin, and the 1936 Winter Olympics held in
   Garmisch-Partenkirchen, to promote the Nazi ideology of the superiority
   of the Aryan race, and inferiority of the Jews and other
   "undesirables".^[65]^[66] Germany used the Olympics to give off a
   peaceful image while secretly preparing for war.^[67]

   When apartheid was the official policy in South Africa, many sports
   people, particularly in rugby union, adopted the conscientious approach
   that they should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this
   was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy
   of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its
   worst effects.^[68]

   In the history of Ireland, Gaelic sports were connected with cultural
   nationalism. Until the mid-20th century a person could have been banned
   from playing Gaelic football, hurling, or other sports administered by
   the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) if she/he played or supported
   Association football, or other games seen to be of British origin.
   Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of football and
   rugby union at Gaelic venues. This ban, also known as Rule 42,^[69] is
   still enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be
   played in Croke Park while Lansdowne Road was redeveloped into Aviva
   Stadium. Until recently, under Rule 21, the GAA also banned members of
   the British security forces and members of the RUC from playing Gaelic
   games, but the advent of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 led to the
   eventual removal of the ban.^[70]

   Nationalism is often evident in the pursuit of sport, or in its
   reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and
   audiences can adopt a partisan view. On occasion, such tensions can
   lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and
   beyond the sporting venue, as in the Football War. These trends are
   seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being
   carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.

   Sport and politics collided in the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Masked men
   entered the hotel of the Israeli Olympic team and killed many of their
   men. This was known as the Munich massacre.

   A study of US elections has shown that the result of sports events can
   affect the results. A study published in the Proceedings of the
   National Academy of Sciences showed that when the home team wins the
   game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their
   share of the vote by 1.5 per cent. A loss had the opposite effect, and
   the effect is greater for higher-profile teams or unexpected wins and
   losses.^[71] Also, when Washington Redskins win their final game before
   an election, then the incumbent president is more likely to win, and if
   the Redskins lose, then the opposition candidate is more likely to win;
   this has become known as the Redskins Rule.^[72]^[73]

  As a means of controlling and subduing populations

   Étienne de La Boétie, in his essay Discourse on Voluntary Servitude
   describes athletic spectacles as means for tyrants to control their
   subjects by distracting them.

     Do not imagine that there is any bird more easily caught by decoy,
     nor any fish sooner fixed on the hook by wormy bait, than are all
     these poor fools neatly tricked into servitude by the slightest
     feather passed, so to speak, before their mouths. Truly it is a
     marvellous thing that they let themselves be caught so quickly at
     the slightest tickling of their fancy. Plays, farces, spectacles,
     gladiators, strange beasts, medals, pictures, and other such
     opiates, these were for ancient peoples the bait toward slavery, the
     price of their liberty, the instruments of tyranny. By these
     practices and enticements the ancient dictators so successfully
     lulled their subjects under the yoke, that the stupefied peoples,
     fascinated by the pastimes and vain pleasures flashed before their
     eyes, learned subservience as naïvely, but not so creditably, as
     little children learn to read by looking at bright picture
     books.^[74]

   During the British rule of Bengal, British and European sports began to
   supplant traditional Bengali sports, resulting in a loss of native
   culture.^[75]^[76]

Religious views

   Main article: New Testament athletic metaphors

   [220px-Panathenaic_amphora_Kleophrades_Louvre_F277.jpg] The foot race
   was one of the events dedicated to Zeus. Panathenaic amphora,
   Kleophrades painter, c. 500 BC, Louvre museum.

   Sport was an important form of worship in Ancient Greek religion. The
   ancient Olympic Games were held in honour of the head deity, Zeus, and
   featured various forms of religious dedication to him and other
   gods.^[77] As many Greeks travelled to see the games, this combination
   of religion and sport also served as a way of uniting them.

   The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some
   Christian thinkers as a form of idolatry, in which "human beings extol
   themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward
   themselves."^[78] Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation
   of "collective pride" and "national self-deification" in which feats of
   human power are idolised at the expense of divine worship.^[78]

   Tertullian condemns the athletic performances of his day, insisting
   "the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon idolatry."^[79] The
   shows, says Tertullian, excite passions foreign to the calm temperament
   cultivated by the Christian:

     God has enjoined us to deal calmly, gently, quietly, and peacefully
     with the Holy Spirit, because these things are alone in keeping with
     the goodness of His nature, with His tenderness and sensitiveness.
     ... Well, how shall this be made to accord with the shows? For the
     show always leads to spiritual agitation, since where there is
     pleasure, there is keenness of feeling giving pleasure its zest; and
     where there is keenness of feeling, there is rivalry giving in turn
     its zest to that. Then, too, where you have rivalry, you have rage,
     bitterness, wrath and grief, with all bad things which flow from
     them – the whole entirely out of keeping with the religion of
     Christ.^[80]

   Christian clerics in the Wesleyan-Holiness movement oppose the viewing
   of or participation in professional sports, believing that professional
   sports leagues profane the Sabbath as in the modern era, certain
   associations hold games on the Lord's Day.^[81] They also criticise
   professional sports for its fostering of a commitment that competes
   with a Christian's primary commitment to God in opposition to 1
   Corinthians 7:35, what they perceive to be a lack of modesty in the
   players' and cheerleaders' uniforms (which are not in conformity with
   the Methodistic doctrine of outward holiness), its association with
   violence in opposition to Hebrews 7:26, what they perceive to be the
   extensive use of profanity among many players that contravenes
   Colossians 3:8–10, and the frequent presence of gambling, as well as
   alcohol and other drugs at sporting events, which go against a
   commitment to teetotalism.^[81]
