   Board games are a great way to break the ice, whether you're at a party
   or hosting a get-together with folks you haven't seen in a while. But
   with so many options available -- from strategy board games to social
   ones that require singing or drawing -- it can be hard to find the
   right one for you and your friends. So while we've written about board
   games before -- including the best two-player board games, best family
   board games, and best board games for kids -- here, I've rounded up the
   24 best board games for adults, according to fellow Strategist
   staffers, contributors, and a variety of people who play them all the
   time.

Best overall party board game for adults

   Just One
--
   From $48

   "Hands down, Just One is our favorite new party game," says Kelsey
   Demers, who runs the board-game blog the Tabletop Family. "It's simple
   to play, a breeze to teach, and utterly addictive." Word-association
   games are a great choice to play with friends in larger groups because
   they are "full of inside-joke possibilities and they let you make new
   memories by reliving old ones," explains Meeple Mountain founder Andy

Best strategy game for adults

   Amigo 'Saboteur' Strategy Card Game
--

   "The premise of Saboteur, an inexpensive, whimsically mining-themed
   game designed by Frederic Moyersoen and produced by German games
   company Amigo, is relatively simple: Players work toward a shared goal,
   but some of their number -- the saboteurs -- are secretly working
   against the majority, the miners," explains Strategist writer Erin
   Schwartz, who compares it to similar games like Mafia and Among Us.
   "Although Saboteur is a tabletop game, the basic unit of play is the
   same, which is talking to your friends to figure out who's working
   against the group." While the game can be played with as few as three,
   Schwartz finds its best for larger groups of five or more players, to
   keep things interesting. The game scales well to groups of different
   skill level and competitiveness, they add. "But with a group of
   seasoned liars and scammers, it can get downright Machiavellian with

Best beginner strategy game for adults

   Ticket to Ride
--
   $27

   If you're looking for a more entry-level strategy game, Ticket to Ride
   is an adventure-style game in which players attempt to cross the
   country and connect cities by building train routes. It is easy to pick
   up "but also offers a level of strategy and tactics just deep enough
   for competitive gamers to return to time and again," says Ian Ross, who
   runs the popular Instagram page Board Games As Art.

Best fast-paced strategy board game for adults

   Raccoon Tycoon
--
   $23

   Strategist senior writer Liza Corsillo discovered this game by way of
   her "strategy-game connoisseur" brother and it quickly became a family
   game-night staple. According to Corsillo, Raccoon Tycoon combines the
   fast play of Ticket to Ride with the social interaction of Settlers of
   Catan, "but is more engaging and fun to look at." Like Ticket to Ride,
   a player will win the game by collecting the most points, "but there
   are multiple ways to earn them -- amassing wealth and owning railroads,
   towns, or buildings -- so it's harder to get bored." Corsillo also

Best drawing-focused board game for adults

   Telestrations

   "This is my favorite party game when mixing kids and adults," says
   Scott Cooper, owner of Seattle-based Blue Highway Games. A cross
   between Pictionary and telephone, each player attempts to draw the
--
   guess what has been drawn on the dry-erase board. Everyone then passes
   their guess -- which ideally matches the previous player's word -- to
   the next player, who is then tasked with drawing it. The game is
   finished once all of the boards have been returned to their original
   player. According to Dr. Michael James Heron of Meeple Like Us, a
   board-game-review site with a focus on accessibility, "It plays really
   quickly, has everyone laughing all of the time, and likely won't
   provoke a single argument." Kurt Refling of Meeple Mountain agrees:

Best adult board game for Solitaire fans

   Dutch Blitz

   Strategist contributor Lauren Guidry loves Dutch Blitz, which has been
   described as a kind of "very energetic solitaire." Guidry calls the
   dopamine hit from a quick game "euphoric," and says she'll often
   persuade her husband to play a few hands between meetings when they are
   working from home together. Dutch Blitz can also be played solo.

Best illustrated board game for adults

   Stonemaier Games `Wingspan' Board Game
--

   As our friends over at Vulture put it: "I can't think of the last time
   a new board game received the kind of widespread acclaim and mainstream
   attention as Wingspan, a game about birds and bird-watching that truly
   integrates its theme into gameplay and features beautiful artwork." The
   game incorporates over 150 species of birds and asks players to collect
   the best birds to add to your aviary. It's also a favorite among actual
   birders for its attention to detail and beautiful illustrations.

Best fast-paced card game for adults

   Bohnanza
--
   $20

   Strategist writer Lauren Ro, who admits she finds most board games
   "needlessly complicated and mind-numbingly boring," says Bohnanza
   converted her from a game skeptic to an enthusiast. "It's fun. It's
   fast. The artwork is delightful. Best of all, it's easy to learn, even
   for a dolt like me." The concept is simple enough: Each player is a
   bean farmer who plants different varieties of beans; players harvest
   their crops in exchange for gold, and the more beans you harvest, the
   more coins you collect. However, the game dictates that you play with a
   fixed hand, meaning you have to play it in the order the cards were
   dealt or drawn, which makes things a bit more complicated since your
   hand dictates which bean you can plant in each field at each turn.
   Players must then barter with one another to trade beans, which adds
   elements of strategy and negotiation to the gameplay. "I didn't think I
   could ever love a game, but this is the only one I actually look
   forward to playing and introducing to friends when there are four or
   more adults in my home," Ro says.

Best beginner campaign-style game for adults

   Charterstone
--
   $52

   "Charterstone is a campaign-style game in which, over the course of 12
   games, you'll build and expand a village shared by you and your
   opponents by constructing buildings and unlocking new elements with
   each play," says Demers. "Consider it the board-game equivalent of a
   Netflix binge," she adds, because you won't be able to stop playing the
   game once you start. The branching storyline slowly grows more
   complicated, and by the end, after you've completed your 12-game
   campaign, "you will have a unique-to-you board game you can play again
   and again."

Best cooperative board game for adults

   Pandemic

   If you find battling a fictional pandemic soothing compared with living
   through one, Pandemic, Greg May, owner of the Uncommons and Hex &
   Company, calls it a "stellar cooperative game." The main objective is
   for players to work together to stop the spread of four diseases and
   save the world. "This is considered a modern classic because it has a
   simple set of rules, it has a theme everyone can get into, and it is
   highly replayable," adds Ronny Alexander of the cooperative board-game
   review site Co-op Board Games.

   If you're looking for a "quick, snappy" game that is easy to pick up,
   but "still has a bit of substance to it," board-game blogger Eric Yurko
   suggests Cascadia. The goal of the game is to create a Pacific
   Northwest ecosystem by collecting different animals. And Yurko has one
   word to describe the work of game designer Randy Flynn: "exceptional."

   According to Yurko, Carcassonne is a "classic," which asks players to
   build cities, roads, and farms. While the gameplay is "very simple,"
   the complexity and fun come from its numerous expansions, making it a
   game you can play for years to come.

   about the cards in their hands. Because of this surprise element, the
   game has lots of potential for replaying. Alexander says, "There are
   plenty of exciting moments in every game of The Mind."

   "a great game to get lost in with a buddy." It blends together a
   traditional card game with role-playing elements as players take on the
   roles of two investigators -- each with their own set of strengths and
   weaknesses -- who attempt to solve the game's mysteries. "This
   experience of mystery and horror is totally worth your attention," he
