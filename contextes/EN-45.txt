   Board games are a great way to break the ice, whether you’re at a party
   or hosting a get-together with folks you haven’t seen in a while. But
   with so many options available — from strategy board games to social
   ones that require singing or drawing — it can be hard to find the right
   one for you and your friends. So while we’ve written about board games
   before — including the best two-player board games, best family board
   games, and best board games for kids — here, I’ve rounded up the 24
   best board games for adults, according to fellow Strategist staffers,
   contributors, and a variety of people who play them all the time.

Best overall party board game for adults

   “Hands down, Just One is our favorite new party game,” says Kelsey
   Demers, who runs the board-game blog the Tabletop Family. “It’s simple
   to play, a breeze to teach, and utterly addictive.” Word-association
   games are a great choice to play with friends in larger groups because
   they are “full of inside-joke possibilities and they let you make new

Best strategy game for adults

   “The premise of Saboteur, an inexpensive, whimsically mining-themed
   game designed by Frederic Moyersoen and produced by German games
   company Amigo, is relatively simple: Players work toward a shared goal,
--
   the majority, the miners,” explains Strategist writer Erin Schwartz,
   who compares it to similar games like Mafia and Among Us. “Although
   Saboteur is a tabletop game, the basic unit of play is the same, which
   is talking to your friends to figure out who’s working against the
   group.” While the game can be played with as few as three, Schwartz
   finds its best for larger groups of five or more players, to keep
   things interesting. The game scales well to groups of different skill
   level and competitiveness, they add. “But with a group of seasoned

   If you’re looking for a more entry-level strategy game, Ticket to Ride
   is an adventure-style game in which players attempt to cross the
   country and connect cities by building train routes. It is easy to pick

   runs the popular Instagram page Board Games As Art.

Best fast-paced strategy board game for adults

--

   Strategist senior writer Liza Corsillo discovered this game by way of
   her “strategy-game connoisseur” brother and it quickly became a family
   game-night staple. According to Corsillo, Raccoon Tycoon combines the
   fast play of Ticket to Ride with the social interaction of Settlers of
   Catan, “but is more engaging and fun to look at.” Like Ticket to Ride,
   a player will win the game by collecting the most points, “but there
   are multiple ways to earn them — amassing wealth and owning railroads,

   basic premise of this spy-themed Czech favorite. Similar to the basic

Best drawing-focused board game for adults

--

   “This is my favorite party game when mixing kids and adults,” says
   Scott Cooper, owner of Seattle-based Blue Highway Games. A cross
   between Pictionary and telephone, each player attempts to draw the
--
   their guess — which ideally matches the previous player’s word — to the
   next player, who is then tasked with drawing it. The game is finished
   once all of the boards have been returned to their original player.
   According to Dr. Michael James Heron of Meeple Like Us, a
   board-game-review site with a focus on accessibility, “It plays really
   quickly, has everyone laughing all of the time, and likely won’t

   attention as Wingspan, a game about birds and bird-watching that truly
   integrates its theme into gameplay and features beautiful artwork.” The
   game incorporates over 150 species of birds and asks players to collect
   the best birds to add to your aviary. It’s also a favorite among actual

Best fast-paced card game for adults

   Strategist writer Lauren Ro, who admits she finds most board games
   “needlessly complicated and mind-numbingly boring,” says Bohnanza
   converted her from a game skeptic to an enthusiast. “It’s fun. It’s
   fast. The artwork is delightful. Best of all, it’s easy to learn, even

   “Charterstone is a campaign-style game in which, over the course of 12
   games, you’ll build and expand a village shared by you and your
   opponents by constructing buildings and unlocking new elements with
   each play,” says Demers. “Consider it the board-game equivalent of a
   Netflix binge,” she adds, because you won’t be able to stop playing the
   game once you start. The branching storyline slowly grows more
   complicated, and by the end, after you’ve completed your 12-game
   campaign, “you will have a unique-to-you board game you can play again
   and again.”

Best adult board game for two players

   Patchwork, created by accomplished game designer Uwe Rosenberg, is one
   of the best two-player games for beginners. The game challenges players
   to strategically collect different pieces to create a quilt. May calls
   it “the perfect game for couples” that is sure to delight “fans of
   Blokus or Tetris.” Cooper adds that although the rules are simple to
   understand and it only takes about 15 minutes to play, the “subtle
   strategy keeps it interesting.” May agrees: “Games are usually quite
