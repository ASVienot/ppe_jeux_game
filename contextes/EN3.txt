   Games about culture play a critical role in enhancing students
   educational experience in several key ways:
    1. Engagement and Interest: Incorporating games into the learning
       process can significantly increase students' engagement levels. The

       step into the shoes of people from other cultures, broadening their
       perspectives and enhancing their empathy. This can foster greater
       cultural sensitivity and respect for diversity.
    5. Memory Retention: The active participation required in games can
       help improve memory retention. Information learned in the course of
       gameplay is often better remembered than information delivered in
       more traditional, passive forms of learning.
    6. Cross-Cultural Communication Skills: Many cultural games encourage
       communication and collaboration among players. This can enhance
       students' ability to communicate effectively with people from
