Psychosocial Impacts of Mobile Game on K12 Students and Trend Exploration for
Future Educational Mobile Games

--

   Due to the popularity and advancement of 4G/5G networks, mobile games
   have already currently become profitable tools for major internet
   platforms. These games are even refined to cover almost all age groups
   of the population rather than the young people. Yet in the perception
   of the public, mobile games have always seemed to be associated with
   various derogatory terms such as interfering with learning, addiction,
   and violence. K12 students usually have less self-control capability,
   and they are undoubtedly the biggest advocates of mobile games. This
   paper summarizes the technological development of mobile games from the
   aspects of hardware and software in chronological order. The
   psychological and social problems that mobile games have brought to K12
   students are analyzed from a neutral perspective. At the end of the
   paper, the future development of educational games and current
   limitations of mobile games are also given for the explorations of
   future trends of game-based education. This position paper aims to
   provide the insight of what psychosocial impacts that the current
   mobile games have on the student, and it may also serve as a reference
   for the how the game-based education has been developing according to
   the mobile technology wise.

   Due to the popularity of smart terminals and the advancement of 5G
   networks, mobile games are currently the most popular type of games, as
   well as profitable tools for major internet platforms. Mobile games can
   be combined from different levels and content categories, covering
   different, personalities and preferences (Martin et al., 2020). As a
   result mobile games are now refined to cover almost all age groups of
   the population, not just young people. Yet in the perception of the
   public, mobile games have always seemed to be associated with various
   derogatory terms such as interfering with learning, addiction and
--
   self-control capability, and they are undoubtedly the biggest advocates
   of mobile game. When they play certain games for long periods of time
   their behavior and psychological state will be changed in a subtle way.
   The main issue is that mobile games may contain unhealthy contents such
   as pornography, violence, ignorance, superstition, etc. which
--
   (Destyanto et al., 2017). In addition, some young people indulge in
   mobile games due to lack of self-control, which not only result in
   harmful influence on their studies but also induces a series of
--
   that modern mass media have a clear negative function of
   “psychoanesthesia.” Some violent mobile games reveal the nature of the
   “psychoanesthesia” function in another textual dimension: they create
--
   cultural way (Kurt et al., 2022). Craig Anderson found that the
   “psychoanesthetic” mechanism of violent mobile games increases the
   physiological arousal of aggressive behavior, cognition, emotions, and
--
   violent behavior has become the main “product component” of mobile
   games “inflicted” on adolescents. Moreover, its basic social
   manifestations can be summarized in four points: firstly, it creates
--
   secondly, it weakens the inhibition process of violence; thirdly, the
   game’s violent reward rules allow aggressive behavior to be imitated
   and reinforced in the “mimetic environment;” and fourthly, the binary
   values of right and wrong in games can reduce young people’s empathy
   (Elsherbiny and Al Maamari, 2021).

   Mobile games do not only imply a behavior, but also contain a value,
   which might be sometimes anti-social in nature. Violent mobile games on
   the Internet may portray the grandeur, hooliganism, and banditry of
--
   adolescent violence. In particular, the propaganda of “materialism” in
   violent online games can easily lead young people to abandon their
   original morals and values, so that the “money first” mentality

   This position paper therefore infer the future development of
   educational games from existing mobile games, and shares some insights
   into the current limitations, and critically analyses the above issues
   from a neutral perspective, discusses the psychological impacts and
   social problems that mobile games may cause for K12 students (Arteaga
   et al., 2012). It also offers the future development of mobile games
   and the limitations of current educational games in order to explore
   future trends in gamified education. This paper can also be considered

Technological Development of Mobile Game

--
   Nowadays, almost everyone who owns a smartphone has been exposed to
   mobile games at one time or another. It may be a mini-game embedded in
   a web page or app, or a large 3D online game like “Arena of Alor” or
   “Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds” (De Gloria et al., 2014). These games
   have a huge update from the mobile games of over a decade ago, both in
   scale and in audio and video experience. And most mobile phones now

   mobile phones, which did not exist on the same level mobile phones in
   10 years ago, which has promoted the development of mobile games
   (Rubino et al., 2015).
--
   requirement for gamers was that their phones could run a particular
   game, but now gamers want smoother games, no lag when playing online,
   and even want their phones to be able to turn on the highest picture
   quality of the game (Ma et al., 2019). This means that the hardware
   that provides key performance in the phone and the network environment
--
   diverse needs of gamers (Wang et al., 2020). Gradually, mobile phones
   and mobile games have worked together to promote growth and form the
   industry shape we see today. In addition to entertainment, mobile games
   also carry part of people’s social needs in their daily lives (Yang and
--
   of about 1 inch, and due to system and network capacity limitations,
   only the games built into the phone could be played, such as Snake,
   Tetris, etc (Figure 1). These were indeed interesting, but they were
   just ordinary games to kill the time.

   the same time, electronic games began to appear on cell phones in
   various forms (Syahrivar et al., 2022). Since Symbian had strict limits

   J2ME development had a maximum memory limit, the vast majority of
   mobile games did not exceed 1 MB in size until the new Symbian system
   appeared in 2006, when these restrictions were lifted one by one (de
--

   The popularity of color-screened phones allowed game developers to see
   the opportunity, and some very well-known games such as Need for Speed,
   Call of Duty, Command and Conquer, and many others launched dedicated
   mobile versions (Berlo et al., 2020). Many small development teams and
   enthusiasts also developed board games such as chess, Texas hold’em
   into mobile versions. A variety of mobile phone native games began to
   appear at this time, such as “Tower Bloxx” and “Galaxy on Fire” in 2005
   were enjoyable for handheld gamers at the time (Haney, 2017). Around
   2005, when client-side mobile games were just exploding, there were
   already many specialized game makers developing mobile games for
   non-smartphones, but limited by the speed and stability of cell phone
--
   In 2008, with the birth of iOS and Android, Apple successfully
   pioneered the touch screen cell phone, after the mobile game from the
   constraints of the physical keyboard, such as “Angry Birds,” “Plants
--
   The introduction of Angry Birds made the public realize for the first
   time that the era of mobile games may be coming (Kalogiannakis et al.,
   2022).
--
   “Angry Birds”, developed by Rovio and launched in 2009, is another
   phenomenal product. Throughout the game, gamers only need to do one
   action, which is to press and hold the bird on the slingshot in the
--
   operation overturned the public’s inherent impression of how mobile
   games are presented, so Fruit Ninja and Cut the Rope, launched a year
   later, both became star products at the time for their sophisticated
   gameplay design and simple sliding operation (Thomas et al., 2019). Few
   people may know that the first release of the game Doodle Jump in 2009
   was developed for touchscreen phones, and only a year later came a

   2010, the popularity of large-screen touch phones with smart systems
   made a radical change in the way mobile games were operated (Thomas et
   al., 2019).

   operating cell phones, but also made hand games free from the
   limitations of the physical keyboard, with new operation ways of

   Take iOS as an example, App Store is the only (or the main) channel
   value, hand game developers still have the leisure of “slow work, fine
   work,” but by the limitation of iPhone ownership, the income of
   developers at this time is much shabbier compared with today (Bagaa et
   al., 2018). For example, in 2011, the highest-grossing handheld game in
   China was “World War II Storm,” and its monthly flow was only $800,000
--
   ushered in the 4G era (Karabiyik et al., 2020). In 2014, the real-time
   competitive MOBA hand game “Vainglory” was launched, emphasizing the
   real-time nature of network online, while “Magic Spirit Summoning,”
   “Tower Legend” and other nurturing RPG games, although the gameplay is
   focused on the standalone part, the official will regularly update a
   large amount of game content to keep the game fresh and the passion of
   gamers, so an efficient network becomes very important (Wang et al.,
--
   rate of 1 Gbps, greatly increasing wireless data bandwidth and enabling
   mobile games with less hourly delay and faster rate, giving gamers a
   better and faster gaming experience (Zappone et al., 2016). Mobile
   games are a cross-regional, cross-cultural, cross-racial, and
   cross-religious entertainment. It allows gamers to realize the ability

   thus making the mobile network a stronger experience. Whether it’s skin
   updates for MOBAs or massive updates for nurturing games, which can be
   downloaded to gamers’ phones faster (Buzzi et al., 2012).
--
   In 2015, “Arena of Alor” was publicly tested together with “We MOBA”
   and other multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, and most
   handheld gamers were brought into the tide of MOBA games (Buzzi et al.,
   2016). These games are not only fast to get started, but also have
   compact gameplay and gorgeous graphics effects, which not only require
--
   (Zhang et al., 2017). The complex lighting and particle effects in the
   game make the CPU and GPU in the SoC take a lot of pressure; at this
   time, the modem in the phone can’t be idle and needs to coordinate the
   network to cope with transferring the various data that occur in the
   game. Such comprehensive needs have led more cell phone manufacturers
   to start launching products that emphasize cell phone performance and
--
   This trend has prompted more developers to bring a wider variety of
   games with richer titles to the mobile platform. Almost every year,
   several topical titles emerge, such as “Crackdown 3” in 2016, “Monument
   Valley 2” in 2017, and “World in Pictures” and “Florence” in 2018,
   which expose more smartphone users to the “video game” entertainment
   genre (Guo et al., 2019). For most gamers, the connected competitive
   games like 2018’s Peaceful Elite handheld, Wild Ride 9: Racing Legends
   and the new Call of Duty Mobile in 2019 are their best choices (Guo et

   smartphones, not only cell phones have changed over the past 10 years,
   but the way we work, live and play games has changed dramatically. As
   5G technology gets closer to us, mobile games will take on a more
   diverse look with new technology and new hardware, such as 5G cloud
   games will also bring richer game products to more gamers, using 5G’s
   high speed and low latency advantages, host and PC games will also
   become possible to load in real time on the mobile side (Habiba and
   Hossain, 2018). This will also bring a different game experience for
   handheld gamers.

   performance continues to increase. The advent of the 5G era will change
   the game experience for gamers at this stage, which is limited by
   equipment and network latency (Akbar et al., 2021). Although 5G is

Psychosocial Effect of Mobile Game on K12 Children Education Performance

Public Awareness—Negative Content of Mobile Game

   Many elementary school students are addicted to mobile games and cannot
   extricate themselves from games, some of them even steal their parents’
   money to recharge for playing games and play truant. They only think
   about the mobile games all day and all night, and think of all the ways
   to play games, so they are not interested in studying at all and their
   academic performance is in a mess. It seems obvious that the more time
   you spend playing games, the worse your academic performance, and there
   are studies that have found a correlation between time spent on video
   games and students’ academic performance (Padilla-Walker et al., 2009).
   But is poor academic performance really the fault of gaming? It is
--
   appreciation and has high expectations of himself, has no outlet for
   his pent-up emotions. But in mobile games he can not only vent his
   stress but also receive a quick reward (Chafouleas et al., 2021). The
   situation of students who are already not excelling in their academic
   performance will get worse because playing games will waste time in
   learning, thus creating a vicious circle (Laws and Millward, 2001),
   i.e., although playing games takes away from our studies, playing games
   may only be one point in the chain, and the reasons that lead us to
   play games are actually more complex.

Why Are Games Addictive but Learning Is Usually NOT?

   Compared with learning, mobile games have distinct advantages that
   games tend to have some measure the progress of participants to some
   extent, meaning that their effort is visible and obvious, whereas
--
   that “hard work doesn’t always lead to progress” (Chen and Gregory,
   2009). The game makes this process visible, turning a large amount into
   many tiny amounts, and it is important to feel that you are improving.
--

   The tasks set in the game are mostly achievable goals, not too easy and
   not too hard. There is a lot of data analysis behind this degree of
   accuracy (Wang et al., 2020). Increasing participation in games is
   linked to their benefits and results. Not so with learning. The average
--

   The game does such a good job of this. It is clear on the game that for
   everything you achieve, you will be rewarded accordingly and your
--
   If we could figure out how humans learn and what motivates people to
   act from the development of games, then apply it beyond games, the
   value it could create is immeasurable, and it would be a
--

The Psychosocial Impact of Mobile Games

   In fact, the psychosocial mechanisms behind playing games deserve more
   attention than academic performance. Often the decline in academic
   performance is the most easily observed, but the relationship between
   playing video games and soft aspects such as feelings of loneliness,
   loss, self-esteem, social anxiety and social skills is often
   overlooked. These commonly overlooked factors largely contribute to
   negative events that influence our perceptions of mobile games (Han et
   al., 2009).
--
   lonely, lack social skills, and are less successful in real life tend
   to spend more time in video games (Winter et al., 2016). In turn,
   playing video games further exacerbates gamers’ feelings of loneliness
   and increased dissatisfaction with life (Kowert et al., 2015).
--

   A successful mobile game is inevitably appealing because of the high
   sense of achievement that teenagers can feel in the game again. Imagine
   that people who are not respected in real life can be admired for their
   virtual achievements in the game, either through kryptonite (spending
   money to increase combat power) or through their skill in playing the
   game. Even if you don’t make it to the top of the leader boards, you
   can still find a presence in a variety of ways. Moreover, in online
   games, without the constraints of real identities and conditions,
   gamers can communicate more flexibly and with less embarrassment of
--
   These people who are dissatisfied with their real lives can find a
   sense of presence in the game in a variety of ways to escape their
   real-life dissatisfaction (Figure 4). However, after being satisfied in

Anti-social Behavior Caused by Mobile Games

   The content of many mobile games is full of fighting and killing,
   gunfire, wild and weird characters, mechanical and rough movements,
--
   students’ moral and psychological health. Those students who are
   addicted to games are often not calm enough, restless, impulsive,
   indifferent to others, and more violent, bringing certain destabilizing
--
   schizophrenia symptoms, and few children who are addicted to mobile
   games are psychologically healthy. Nowadays, anti-social behavior also
   brings much attention to mobile game study. Although video games have
   been designed and developed to entertain (or educate), it has to be
--
   children’s learning and development, as early as 15 years ago, 89% of
   all games contained violent content, and nearly half of them contained
   severe violence (Bulduklu, 2017).

   Researchers have found that excessive immersion in games with
   antisocial content (violence) can easily lead to addiction and that
   such games have a subtle effect on gamers: they lack empathy and are
   prone to destructive behavior in real life. In fact, for gamers, the
--
   become accustomed to such aggressive emotions and destructive behavior
   in games, which they gradually carry over into real life (Huizenga et
   al., 2009).
--
   In a study conducted in 2011, Anderson and Bushman surveyed over 4,000
   gamers and found that violent games increased aggressive emotions and
   decreased pro-social behaviour. Both children and adults, men and women
--
   say that violent play necessarily leads to violent behavior. However,
   when we are constantly trained to think about our enemies in games and
   reinforced to react quickly and aggressively to each other’s actions,
--

   It must be clear here that it is not the video game that causes the
   gamer’s antisocial behavior, but the violent content of the video game.
   It is pointless and even counterproductive to make a blanket statement.
   We should advocate for the regulation of the video game market and the
   development of sensible game content, rather than a blanket ban on all
   video games.

The Core Educational Value of Mobile Games

   Most scholars are studying how to make learning more interesting, so
   that students can learn by doing as what the mobile game does. This is
   the dream of our educational researchers, and Dewey’s emphasis on
--
   educational scholars are proposing to implement gamified learning,
   using educational games to achieve gamified learning. Gamified learning
   in a narrow sense generally refers to pure video games, while gamified
   learning in a broad sense includes game mechanics, game element design
   concepts, etc.

   The core educational values of games are mainly acting on the aspects
   of psychology, socialization, and culture. With its effect on play
   motivation, playful thinking, and playfulness (Figure 5), a good mobile
   game does need multiple aspects of knowledge, ability, emotions,
   attitudes and values (Schwab, 2018). Play motivation is the most
--
   and emphasizes the design of non-playful learning activities as
   “games.” Playfulness is the most meaningful value emphasizing that
   learners approach the process and outcomes of learning with the same
--

   Figure 5. Core educational value of mobile games.

Gamification of Education/Educational Mobile Games

--
   Gamification of education is more suitable for the K12 age group and
   should generally be in the form of simple games, with the degree of
   gamification decreasing with the age of the user increasing; there will
   be some adults over 18 who prefer educational products in the form of
   large-scale games such as online games, but this may be a niche market
   (Abeele et al., 2017). A light game should be a balance between
   learning and gameplay, it is like a layer of ketchup in the middle of a
   hamburger, it can be a little less, but too much is definitely not. If
   the game is too complex, it will take away from the main focus, the
   child will appear to be learning but spend more time playing, and the
--
   solution, not optional. Otherwise, even the best design will be
   short-lived and will end up like a normal game after its life cycle.
   So, as well as the product team, the operations team is equally

Future Trends and Limitations in Educational Mobile Games

--
   et al., 2016; Black et al., 2018). If the research is to solve
   students’ learning problems through mobile games, it is necessary to
   combine various research results and educational results from game
   design. Experimental research in this area has been conducted and found
   it to be quite effective. Through this experiment, it is found that the
   difficulty in developing this type of game is decided by how it can
   really enhance their learning effectiveness (Calpbinici and Tas Arslan,
--

   Still, games are games, and still there are four major limitation for
   the current development of educational mobile games.:

   • The first major limitation is portability, that is, how what is
   learned in a mobile game transfers to the real world, which exposes the
   Achilles heel of mobile games. The challenges in video games are often
   fictional and have no connection to everyday life, but are rather a
   fantasy. The knowledge and skills that K12 students acquire in games
   such as battling dragons, racing jousts, and Tetris are not meaningful
--

   • The second major limitation is simplicity. Mobile games simplify
   complex systems to their core and are procedural representations of the
   real world. The world we live in is much more complex and often defies
   the simple logic of the game. This results in learners often losing
   touch with the systems modeled in the game.

   • The third major limitation is that games lack real-life environments.
   Mobile games are not designed to have an effect on the gamer after the
   game is over. The K12 students are too different from the world they
   live in, and the real world is too complex. Even those games that have
   a realistic purpose, so-called serious games or educational games,
   mostly fail in their transfer from the game to the real world. This is
   good news for those who fear that violent games make people violent,
   and bad news for those who think that smart games automatically make
   people smart.
--
   environment. K12 students are usually unable to spontaneously establish
   a relationship between what they learn in mobile games and real life.
   They can grasp a great deal of information in mobile games and remember
   it over time, but are unable to recall the simplest historical data in
   the classroom. The link between learning achievements in games and in
   the real world is often overlooked by many K12 students and teachers.

   Games open the door to the transfer of learning experiences, but K12
   students must go through this door themselves. For that matter, the
   role of teaching behavior in the use of mobile games is clearly
   underestimated. Learners need constructive support to draw outcomes
--
   but there is a difference in the logical growth and understanding of
   games (Rahim et al., 2020). Besides, the illusory nature of the mobile
   gaming experience makes the transfer of results very difficult. In
--
   that need to be answered on the teaching side are which real-world
   environments can apply what is learned in the game and which aspects of
   the game are worth learning from. And gamers, the K12 students, should
   be motivated to notice this connection and to test what they have
--

   This paper summarizes the technological development of mobile games
   from the aspects of hardware and software. A neutral perspective is
   given to analyze the psychological and social problems that mobile
   games have brought to K12 students. At the end of the paper, the
   insights of the future development of educational games and current
   limitations of mobile games are also addressed. The major task for the
   development is to reflect on the content of the mobile game, which is
   not directly accessible. It is difficult to examine what is learned
