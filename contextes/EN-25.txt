   Common pheasant, widely introduced and hunted as game

   Game or quarry is any wild animal hunted for animal products (primarily
   meat), for recreation ("sporting"), or for trophies.^[1] The species of
   animals hunted as game varies in different parts of the world and by
   different local jurisdictions, though most are terrestrial mammals and
   birds. Fish caught non-commercially (recreational fishing) are also
   referred to as game fish.

   In some countries, game is classified, including legal classifications
   with respect to licenses required, as either "small game" or "large
   game". A single small game licence may cover all small game species and
   be subject to yearly bag limits. Large game are often subject to
   individual licensing where a separate permit is required for each

   South Africa is a famous destination for game hunting, with its large
   biodiversity and therefore impressive variety of game species. Many
   creatures have returned to former areas from which they were once taken
   as a result of being killed for big-game hunting. Commonly hunted
   species include:

   In the UK game is defined in law by the Game Act 1831. It is illegal to
   shoot game on Sundays or at night. Other non-game birds that are hunted

   1981. UK law defines game as including:
     * Black grouse (No longer hunted due to decline in numbers)

   Game meat is typically taken from a wild animal that has been shot with
   a gun or bow. Hunters must be absolutely certain of their target before
   shooting and should make every effort to get the animal down as quickly
   and painlessly as possible. Once obtained, game meat must be processed
   to avoid spoiling. The method of processing varies by game species and
   size. Small game and fowl may simply be carried home to be butchered.
   Large game such as deer is quickly field-dressed by removing the
   viscera in the field, while very large animals like moose may be

   Traditionally, game meat was hung until "high" or "gamey", that is,
   approaching a state of decomposition.^[4] However, this adds to the
   risk of contamination. Small game can be processed essentially intact,
   after gutting and skinning or defeathering (by species). Small animals
   are ready for cooking, although they may be disjointed first. Large
   game must be processed by techniques commonly practiced by commercial
   butchers.

     * Game

   Generally game is cooked in the same ways as farmed meat.^[5] Because
   some game meat is leaner than store-bought beef, overcooking is a
   common mishap which can be avoided if properly prepared.^[6]^[7] It is
   sometimes grilled or cooked longer or by slow cooking or moist-heat
   methods to make it more tender, since some game tends to be tougher
   than farm-raised meat. Other methods of tenderizing include marinating
   as in the dish Hasenpfeffer, cooking in a game pie or as a stew such as
   burgoo.
