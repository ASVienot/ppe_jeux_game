Card game

--
   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Game using playing cards as the primary device
   For other uses, see Card game (disambiguation).

--

   A card game is any game using playing cards as the primary device with
   which the game is played, be they traditional or game-specific.
   Countless card games exist, including families of related games (such
   as poker). A small number of card games played with traditional decks
   have formally standardized rules with international tournaments being
   held, but most are folk games whose rules may vary by region, culture,
   location or from circle to circle.

   Traditional card games are played with a deck or pack of playing cards
   which are identical in size and shape. Each card has two sides, the
--
   In some cases several decks are shuffled together to form a single pack
   or shoe. Modern card games usually have bespoke decks, often with a
   vast amount of cards, and can include number or action cards. This type
   of game is generally regarded as part of the board game hobby.

   Games using playing cards exploit the fact that cards are individually
   identifiable from one side only, so that each player knows only the
   cards they hold and not those held by anyone else. For this reason card
   games are often characterized as games of chance or "imperfect
   information"—as distinct from games of strategy or perfect information,
   where the current position is fully visible to all players throughout
   the game.^[1] Many games that are not generally placed in the family of
   card games do in fact use cards for some aspect of their play.

   Some games that are placed in the card game genre involve a board. The
   distinction is that the play in a card game chiefly depends on the use
   of the cards by players (the board is a guide for scorekeeping or for
   card placement), while board games (the principal non-card game genre
   to use cards) generally focus on the players' positions on the board,

   Despite the presence of playing cards in Europe being recorded from
   around 1370, it is not until 1408 that the first card game is described
   in a document about the exploits of two card sharps; although it is
   evidently very simple, the game is not named. In fact the earliest
   games to be mentioned by name are Gleek, Ronfa and Condemnade, the
   latter being the game played by the aforementioned card cheats. All
   three are recorded during the 15th century,^[2] along with Karnöffel,

   Since the arrival trick-taking games in Europe in the late 14th
   century, there have only been two major innovations. The first was the
--
   example of such cards was ordered by the Duke of Milan around 1420 and
   included 16 trumps with images of Greek and Roman gods.^[5] Thus games
   played with Tarot cards appeared very early on and spread to most parts
--
   Peninsula, and the Balkans.^[6] However, we do not know the rules of
   the early Tarot games; the earliest detailed description in any
   language being those published by the Abbé de Marolles in Nevers in
--
   The concept of trumps was sufficiently powerful that it was soon
   transferred to games played with far cheaper ordinary packs of cards,
   as opposed to expensive Tarot cards. The first of these was Triomphe,
--
   Spaniard who left his native country for Milan in 1509 never to return;
   thus the game may date to the late 15th century.^[9]^[10]^[11]

   Others games that may well date to the 15th century are Pochen – the
   game of Bocken or Boeckels being attested in Strasbourg in 1441^[12] –
   and Thirty-One, which is first mentioned in a French translation of a
   1440 sermon by the Italian, Saint Bernadine, the name actually
   referring to two different card games: one like Pontoon and one like
   Commerce.^[13]
--
   In the 16th century printed documents replace handwritten sources and
   card games become a popular topic with preachers, autobiographists and
   writers in general. A key source of the games in vogue in France and
   Europe at that time is François Rabelais, whose fictional character
   Gargantua played no less than 30 card games, many of which are
   recognisable. They include: Aluette, Bête, Cent, Coquimbert, Coucou,

   Cardano also provides invaluable information including the earliest
   rules of Trappola. Among the most popular were the games of Flusso and
   Primiera, which originated in Italy and spread throughout Europe,

   In Britain the earliest known European fishing game was recorded in
   1522.^[15] Another first was Losing Loadum, noted by Florio in 1591,
   which is the earliest known English point-trick game.^[16] In Scotland,
   the game of Mawe, testified in the 1550s, evolved from a country game
   into one played at the royal Scottish court, becoming a favourite of
   James VI.^[17] The ancestor of Cribbage – a game called Noddy – is
   mentioned for the first time in 1589, "Noddy" being the Knave turned
--

   The 17th century saw an upsurge in the number of new games being
   reported as well as the first sets of rules, those for Piquet appearing
   in 1632 and Reversis in 1634.^[8] The first French games compendium, La
   Maison Académique, appeared in 1654 and it was followed in 1674 by
   Charles Cotton's The Compleat Gamester, although an earlier manuscript
   of games by Francis Willughby was written sometime between 1665 and
   1670.^[19] Cotton records the first rules for the classic English games
   of Cribbage, a descendant of Noddy, and Whist, a development of English

   Piquet was a two-player, trick-taking game that originated in France,
   probably in the 16th century and was initially played with 36 cards
   before, around 1690, the pack reduced to the 32 cards that gives the
   Piquet pack its name. Reversis is a reverse game in which players avoid
   taking tricks and appears to be an Italian invention that came to

   In the mid-17th century, a certain game named after Cardinal Mazarin,
   prime minister to King Louis XIV, became very popular at the French
   royal court. Called Hoc Mazarin, it had three phases, the final one of
   which evolved into a much simpler game called Manille that was renamed
   Comète on the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1682.^[21] In Comète the

   advantage of being able to start a new sequence. This concept spread to
   other 17th and 18th century games including Poque, Comete, Emprunt,
   Manille, Nain Jaune and Lindor,^[22]^[23] all except Emprunt being
--
   It was the 17th century that saw the second of the two great
   innovations being introduced into trick-taking games: the concept of
   bidding.^[3] This first emerged in the Spanish game of Ombre, an
   evolution of Triomphe that "in its time, was the most successful card
   game ever invented."^[24] Ombre's origins are unclear and obfuscated by
   the existence of a game called Homme or Bête in France, ombre and homme
   being respectively Spanish and French for 'man'. In Ombre, the player
   who won the bidding became the "Man" and played alone against the other
   two. The game spread rapidly across Europe, spawning variants for
   different numbers of players and known as Quadrille, Quintille,

   The first rules of any game in the German language were those for
   Rümpffen published in 1608 and later expanded in several subsequent
   editions. In addition, the first German games compendium, Palamedes
   Redivivus appeared in 1678, containing the rules for Hoick (Hoc),

   The evolution of card games continued apace, with notable national
   games emerging like Briscola and Tressette (Italy), Schafkopf
   (Bavaria), Jass (Switzerland), Mariage, the ancestor of Austria's
   Schnapsen and Germany's Sixty-Six, and Tapp Tarock, the progenitor of
   most modern central European Tarot games. Whist spread to the continent
   becoming very popular in the north and west. In France, Comet appeared,
   a game that later evolved into Nain Jaune and the Victorian game of
   Pope Joan.

Trick-taking games[edit]

   See also: List of trick-taking games

   There are two main types of trick-taking game which have different
   objectives. Both are based on the play of multiple tricks, in each of
--
   values of played cards one player wins or "takes" the trick.
     * Plain-trick games. Many common Anglo-American games fall into this
       category. The usual objective is to take the most tricks, but
--
       Whist and Spades are popular examples. Hearts, Black Lady and Black
       Maria are examples of reverse games in which the aim is to avoid
       certain cards.

     * Point-trick games. These are all European or of European origin.
       Individual cards have specific point values and the objective is
--
       especially those with higher value cards. The main group is the
       Ace-Ten family which includes many national games such as German
       Skat, French Belote, Dutch Klaberjass, Austrian Schnapsen, Spanish
--
       Mariáš. Pinochle is an American example of French or Swiss origin.
       All Tarot card games are of the point-trick variety including
       German Cego, Austrian Tarock, French Tarot and Italian Minchiate.

Matching games[edit]

   Main article: Matching game

   The object of a matching (or sometimes "melding") game is to acquire
   particular groups of matching cards before an opponent can do so. In
   Rummy, this is done through drawing and discarding, and the groups are
   called melds. Mahjong is a very similar game played with tiles instead
   of cards. Non-Rummy examples of match-type games generally fall into
   the "fishing" genre and include the children's games Go Fish and Old
   Maid.

Shedding games[edit]

   See also: Category:Shedding-type card games and List of shedding-type
   games

   In a shedding game, players start with a hand of cards, and the object
   of the game is to be the first player to discard all cards from one's
   hand. Common shedding games include Crazy Eights (commercialized by
   Mattel as Uno) and Daihinmin. Some matching-type games are also
   shedding-type games; some variants of Rummy such as Paskahousu, Phase
   10, Rummikub, the bluffing game I Doubt It, and the children's games
   Musta Maija and Old Maid, fall into both categories.

Catch and collect games[edit]

   See also: Category:Catch and collect games

   The object of an accumulating game is to acquire all cards in the deck.
   Examples include most War type games, and games involving slapping a
   discard pile such as Slapjack. Egyptian Ratscrew has both of these

Fishing games[edit]

   "Fishing game" redirects here. For the video game genre, see fishing
   video game.

   See also: Category:Fishing card games

   In fishing games, cards from the hand are played against cards in a
   layout on the table, capturing table cards if they match.^[25] Fishing
   games are popular in many nations, including China, where there are
   many diverse fishing games. Scopa is considered one of the national
   card games of Italy. Cassino is the only fishing game to be widely
   played in English-speaking countries. Zwicker has been described as a
   "simpler and jollier version of Cassino", played in Germany.^[26]
   Tablanet (tablić) is a fishing-style game popular in Balkans.

  Comparing games[edit]

   See also: Category:Comparing card games

   Comparing card games are those where hand values are compared to
   determine the winner, also known as "vying" or "showdown" games. Poker,
   blackjack, mus, and baccarat are examples of comparing card games. As
   seen, nearly all of these games are designed as gambling games.

  Drinking card games[edit]

   See also: Category:Drinking card games

   Drinking card games are drinking games using cards, in which the object
   in playing the game is either to drink or to force others to drink.
   Many games are ordinary card games with the establishment of "drinking
   rules"; President, for instance, is virtually identical to Daihinmin
   but with additional rules governing drinking. Poker can also be played
   using a number of drinks as the wager. Another game often played as a
   drinking game is Toepen, quite popular in the Netherlands. Some card
   games are designed specifically to be played as drinking games.

  Compendium games[edit]

   Compendium games consist of a sequence of different contracts played in
   succession. A common pattern is for a number of reverse deals to be
   played, in which the aim is to avoid certain cards, followed by a final
   contract which is a domino-type game. Examples include: Barbu, Herzeln,
   Lorum and Rosbiratschka. In other games, such as Quodlibet and Rumpel,
   there is a range of widely varying contracts.

  Collectible card games (CCGs)[edit]

   See also: Collectible card game, List of collectible card games, and
   Category:Collectible card games

   Collectible card games (CCG) are proprietary playing card games. CCGs
   are games of strategy between two or more players. Each player has
   their own deck constructed from a very large pool of unique cards in
--
   art. New card sets are released periodically and sold as starter decks
   or booster packs. Obtaining the different cards makes the game a
   collectible card game, and cards are sold or traded on the secondary
   market. Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon, and Yu-Gi-Oh! are well-known
   collectible card games.

  Living card games (LCGs)[edit]

   See also: Living card game and Fantasy Flight Games

   Living card games (LCGs) are similar to collectible card games (CCGs),
   with their most distinguishing feature being a fixed distribution
   method, which breaks away from the traditional collectible card game
   format. While new cards for CCGs are usually sold in the form of
--
   LCGs thrive on a model that requires players to acquire one core set in
   order to play the game, which players can further customize by
   acquiring extra sets or expansions featuring new content in the form of

   content. The term was popularized by Fantasy Flight Games (FFG) and
   mainly applies to its products, however some tabletop gaming companies

   each other, such as poker, while in others, like blackjack, players

  Other card games[edit]

   Many other card games have been designed and published on a commercial
   or amateur basis. In some cases, the game uses the standard 52-card
   deck, but the object is unique. In Eleusis, for example, players play
--

   Most of these games however typically use a specially made deck of
   cards designed specifically for the game (or variations of it). The
   decks are thus usually proprietary, but may be created by the game's
   players. Uno, Phase 10, Set, and 1000 Blank White Cards are popular
   dedicated-deck card games; 1000 Blank White Cards is unique in that the
   cards for the game are designed by the players of the game while
   playing it; there is no commercially available deck advertised as such.

   Any specific card game imposes restrictions on the number of players.
   The most significant dividing lines run between one-player games and
   two-player games, and between two-player games and multi-player games.
   Card games for one player are known as solitaire or patience card
   games. (See list of solitaire card games.) Generally speaking, they are
   in many ways special and atypical, although some of them have given
   rise to two- or multi-player games such as Spite and Malice.

   In card games for two players, usually not all cards are distributed to
   the players, as they would otherwise have perfect information about the
   game state. Two-player games have always been immensely popular and
   include some of the most significant card games such as piquet,
   bezique, sixty-six, klaberjass, gin rummy and cribbage. Many
   multi-player games started as two-player games that were adapted to a
   greater number of players. For such adaptations a number of non-obvious
   choices must be made beginning with the choice of a game orientation.

   One way of extending a two-player game to more players is by building
   two teams of equal size. A common case is four players in two fixed
--
   usually restricted to a specific list of permitted signs and signals.
   17th-century French partnership games such as triomphe were special in
   that partners sat next to each other and were allowed to communicate
--

   Another way of extending a two-player game to more players is as a
   cut-throat or individual game, in which all players play for
   themselves, and win or lose alone. Most such card games are round
   games, i.e. they can be played by any number of players starting from
   two or three, so long as there are enough cards for all.

   For some of the most interesting games such as ombre, tarot and skat,
   the associations between players change from hand to hand. Ultimately
   players all play on their own, but for each hand, some game mechanism
   divides the players into two teams. Most typically these are solo
   games, i.e. games in which one player becomes the soloist and has to
   achieve some objective against the others, who form a team and win or
   lose all their points jointly. But in games for more than three
   players, there may also be a mechanism that selects two players who
--

   The players of a card game normally form a circle around a table or
   other space that can hold cards. The game orientation or direction of
   play, which is only relevant for three or more players, can be either
   clockwise or counterclockwise. It is the direction in which various
   roles in the game proceed. (In real-time card games, there may be no
   need for a direction of play.) Most regions have a traditional
--

   Games that originate in a region with a strong preference are often
   initially played in the original direction, even in regions that prefer
   the opposite direction. For games that have official rules and are
   played in tournaments, the direction of play is often prescribed in
--

   Most games have some form of asymmetry between players. The roles of
   players are normally expressed in terms of the dealer, i.e. the player
--
   players. Being the dealer can be a (minor or major) advantage or
   disadvantage, depending on the game. Therefore, after each played hand,
   the deal normally passes to the next player according to the game
   orientation.
--
   becomes dealer. In the case of a tie, the process is repeated by the
   tied players. For some games such as whist this process of cutting is
   part of the official rules, and the hierarchy of cards for the purpose
   of cutting (which need not be the same as that used otherwise in the
   game) is also specified. But in general, any method can be used, such
   as tossing a coin in case of a two-player game, drawing cards until one
   player draws an ace, or rolling dice.

  Hands, rounds and games[edit]

   A hand, also called a deal, is a unit of the game that begins with the
   dealer shuffling and dealing the cards as described below, and ends
--
   player who sits after the dealer in the direction of play is known as
   eldest hand (or in two-player games as elder hand) or forehand. A game
   round consists of as many hands as there are players. After each hand,
--
   eldest hand becomes the new dealer. Normally players score points after
   each hand. A game may consist of a fixed number of rounds.
   Alternatively it can be played for a fixed number of points. In this
--

   For casino games that are played for large sums it is vital that the
   cards be properly randomized, but for many games this is less critical,
   and in fact player experience can suffer when the cards are shuffled
--
   dealer then offers the deck to the previous player (in the sense of the
   game direction) for cutting. If the deal is clockwise, this is the
   player to the dealer's right; if counterclockwise, it is the player to
--
   the stock (also called the talon, widow, skat or kitty depending on the
   game and region).

--
   the cards but not the other players, or vice versa depending on the
   game. It is helpful to fan one's cards out so that if they have corner
   indices all their values can be seen at once. In most games, it is also
   useful to sort one's hand, rearranging the cards in a way appropriate
   to the game. For example, in a trick-taking game it may be easier to
   have all one's cards of the same suit together, whereas in a rummy game
   one might sort them by rank or by potential combinations.
--

   A new card game starts in a small way, either as someone's invention,
   or as a modification of an existing game. Those playing it may agree to
   change the rules as they wish. The rules that they agree on become the
   "house rules" under which they play the game. A set of house rules may
   be accepted as valid by a group of players wherever they play, as it
--

   When a game becomes sufficiently popular, so that people often play it
   with strangers, there is a need for a generally accepted set of rules.
--
   There is nothing static or "official" about this process. For the
   majority of games, there is no one set of universal rules by which the
   game is played, and the most common ruleset is no more or less than
   that. Many widely played card games, such as Canasta and Pinochle, have
   no official regulating body. The most common ruleset is often
   determined by the most popular distribution of rulebooks for card
   games. Perhaps the original compilation of popular playing card games
   was collected by Edmund Hoyle, a self-made authority on many popular
   parlor games. The U.S. Playing Card Company now owns the eponymous
   Hoyle brand, and publishes a series of rulebooks for various families
   of card games that have largely standardized the games' rules in
   countries and languages where the rulebooks are widely distributed.
--

   If there is a sense in which a card game can have an official set of
   rules, it is when that card game has an "official" governing body. For
   example, the rules of tournament bridge are governed by the World
--
   down by the Schafkopfschule in Munich. Even in these cases, the rules
   must only be followed at games sanctioned by these governing bodies or
   where the tournament organisers specify them. Players in informal

   An infraction is any action which is against the rules of the game,
   such as playing a card when it is not one's turn to play or the
--

   In many official sets of rules for card games, the rules specifying the
   penalties for various infractions occupy more pages than the rules
   specifying how to play correctly. This is tedious but necessary for
   games that are played seriously. Players who intend to play a card game
   at a high level generally ensure before beginning that all agree on the
--

   If a player breaks the rules of a game deliberately, this is cheating.
   The rest of this section is therefore about accidental infractions,
--

   As the same game is played repeatedly among a group of players,
   precedents build up about how a particular infraction of the rules

   formalized, as described in the previous section. Therefore, for some
   games, there is a "proper" way of handling infractions of the rules.
   But for many games, without governing bodies, there is no standard way
   of handling infractions.

   should not lose by it. An exception to this may be made in games with
