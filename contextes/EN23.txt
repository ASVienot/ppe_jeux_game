   Research has shown that there are many benefits to playing games in the
   classroom. When planning lessons, teachers should try to incorporate at
   least one game a day into one of the key learning areas as either a
   teaching and learning tool, assessment strategy or classroom motivator.

   Games are a great way to control the competitiveness between peers.

   By using games in the classroom, students can compete against each
   other whilst playing a game, then support each other during other
   learning activities.

Strategy Simulator

   Most games require problem-solving strategies and planning. By applying
   a range of strategies in a game, students are able to use their working
   memory to solve problems, increasing their mental cognition.
   Stimulating the brain with strategies in a game can be a great brain
   workout!

Mighty Memory

   Playing a range of content-specific games can increase memory! As they
   play a game, students need to remember important details about a topic
   but also use their working memory to think and act quickly.

   Games that were made by the students can be some of the most effective.
   As students construct a game they are required to use their memory of
   specific content to create questions and answers suitable for the game,
   then use their memory of the topic to play the game.

Class Cooperation

   Playing games in the classroom increases class cooperation. Classroom
   games can also be used as a team-building exercise!

   Students need to work together as a team when playing as a whole class
   against the teacher, or in small team groups when playing games with
   each other.

Alert Attention

   Playing games requires students to pay great attention to detail. As
   games can move quickly, when playing a game a student needs to be alert
   and attentive.

   This attentiveness when playing a game can help students to stay
   focused on other tasks in the classroom throughout the day.

Friendly Fun

   and gives students a feeling of euphoria. This feeling of euphoria
   creates a great sense of happiness and excitement for students in the

   knowledge.

   After teaching new content to the class, provide students with a game
   that will consolidate their understanding and make connections with
   what they already know. Asking students to create their own
   content-specific games can also be a great way to assess students at
   the end of a unit of work.
