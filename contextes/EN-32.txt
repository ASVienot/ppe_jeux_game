Why We Play Boardgames

   My husband and I have spent the last ten years playing board games
   together. No, I’m not talking about seeing if we need anger management

   together learning card games, and teaching each other our family
   favorites. When we tired of Canasta and Sequence, we began looking for

   shelves full of games that have brought us, our family, and our friends
   closer together through hours spent laughing, playing, and enjoying
   each others company over the many different games brought to the table.

   every family can benefit by incorporating board games into their lives.
   Yes, I know that may sound a bit nerdy, but here us out.

   together and bond; no places to be except home with each other. We use
   this time to play games with our kids. Now, our kids are young, so it’s
   not always as idyllic as we go into it hoping it will be. But what we

   game or not.

   Games also allow us to have great date nights at home. Finding a sitter
   for four kids 6 and under can be hard, and after paying for the sitter,

   one another. We’ll put the kids to bed, come downstairs, and for a few
   hours we’ll take time to play a game. Maybe we’ll even spend what we
   would have spent on a date and get a new game to enjoy; when it comes
   to bang for your buck, you can’t beat buying a board game that you will
   be able to enjoy a countless number of times rather than just once.

   more and more ways to unplug. When we spend a night engaged in a board
   game, we walk away with memories, laughs, and a fun experience that can
   only come from face-to-face social interaction. Board games are
   incredibly versatile; you can take them with you to play indoors or

   You’d be surprised by the level of mental engagement required to play
   modern board games. In games like Candyland, the winner is already
   determined before the first card has even been flipped – there is
   nothing you can do. But in today’s board games you have a variety of
   styles, from puzzles to tactical area control games to keep you and
   your brain sharp and always thinking. The challenges provided by
   physical board games are better than anything you’ll find in some app,
   even apps of the board games you might be playing.

   spend time connecting with people, old friends and new. The board game
   is really just a vehicle for us to bring people together and enjoy each
   others company. Over the last ten years we’ve had our fair share of
   friends and family that have told us that they “don’t like board games”
   and time and time again, we’ve found that there truly is something for

   You don’t have to like every game, we certainly don’t, but the
   diversity offered by today’s games is simply incredible and if you’ve
