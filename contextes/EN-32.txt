Why We Play Boardgames

   My husband and I have spent the last ten years playing board games
   together. No, I‚Äôm not talking about seeing if we need anger management

   movie or going to college parties, we spent the majority of our time
   together learning card games, and teaching each other our family
   favorites. When we tired of Canasta and Sequence, we began looking for

   have dove head first into the deep end where our hobby has grown into
   shelves full of games that have brought us, our family, and our friends
   closer together through hours spent laughing, playing, and enjoying
   each others company over the many different games brought to the table.

   important part of our family for us and our four kids. We think that
   every family can benefit by incorporating board games into their lives.
   Yes, I know that may sound a bit nerdy, but here us out.

   together and bond; no places to be except home with each other. We use
   this time to play games with our kids. Now, our kids are young, so it‚Äôs
   not always as idyllic as we go into it hoping it will be. But what we

   together and finding joy in simple fun, whether that comes from a board
   game or not.

   Games also allow us to have great date nights at home. Finding a sitter
   for four kids 6 and under can be hard, and after paying for the sitter,

   one another. We‚Äôll put the kids to bed, come downstairs, and for a few
   hours we‚Äôll take time to play a game. Maybe we‚Äôll even spend what we
   would have spent on a date and get a new game to enjoy; when it comes
   to bang for your buck, you can‚Äôt beat buying a board game that you will
   be able to enjoy a countless number of times rather than just once.

   more and more ways to unplug. When we spend a night engaged in a board
   game, we walk away with memories, laughs, and a fun experience that can
   only come from face-to-face social interaction. Board games are
   incredibly versatile; you can take them with you to play indoors or

   You‚Äôd be surprised by the level of mental engagement required to play
   modern board games. In games like Candyland, the winner is already
   determined before the first card has even been flipped ‚Äì there is
   nothing you can do. But in today‚Äôs board games you have a variety of
   styles, from puzzles to tactical area control games to keep you and
   your brain sharp and always thinking. The challenges provided by
   physical board games are better than anything you‚Äôll find in some app,
   even apps of the board games you might be playing.

   this really has developed into a passion for us. We board game for many
   reasons, more than even listed above, but the main reason is, without a

   friends. We love being able to gather round a table, phones aside, and
   spend time connecting with people, old friends and new. The board game
   is really just a vehicle for us to bring people together and enjoy each
   others company. Over the last ten years we‚Äôve had our fair share of
   friends and family that have told us that they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like board games‚Äù
   and time and time again, we‚Äôve found that there truly is something for

   You don‚Äôt have to like every game, we certainly don‚Äôt, but the
   diversity offered by today‚Äôs games is simply incredible and if you‚Äôve
   made it this far down this post and are wondering where to start, then

   who will let us and especially our kids who have no choice! So without
   further ado, here are some board game ideas to get you started!

   This game has really broken through the hobby wall and has become much
   more mainstream over the years, you may have even seen it in your local

   This game has a multitude of expansions offering different train maps
   featuring different countries and states, but we recommend the original
   game with the North American map to start and it is great for the whole
   family starting at about age 8.

   game several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all
   across the globe and it is your mission to fight these while

   gamers as young as 6, but don‚Äôt let that deter you, this is far from a
   kid game and will offer tons of fun for teens and adult gamers as
   well.

   their pieces from an island that is breaking up while remembering where

   sabotage each other‚Äôs escape plans so you can stand victorious with the
   most points on shore before the island blows up. This game plays up to
   four and works well for ages 6 and above.
