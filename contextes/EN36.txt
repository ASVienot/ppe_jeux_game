   consumption of video games and the negative consequences thereof for
   girls.

   Different researchers have used different cutoffs of the criteria to
   establish a diagnosis (5–8), others have focused strictly on online
   games (9), and some researchers have adopted their own criteria for
   disordered gaming (10, 11). One of the most frequently used
   questionnaires for disordered gaming in adolescents is the GASA (Game

   with addiction while the contrary is true for the criteria for
   withdrawal, relapse, conflicts and problems (5, 13, 14). The core
   approach thus distinguishes engaged gamers from problem- and addicted
   gamers by emphasizing the “core criteria” namely, withdrawal, relapse,
   conflict and problems in order to yield a more precise and relevant
   estimate of prevalence whereby a diagnosis of game addiction should be
   related to comorbidity and interference rather than high engagement

   dimensions in GamTest (23). The application of this psycho-social model
   specification enables an exploration of over consumption as an
   explanatory variable for problematic use of games rather than just
   charting peripheral components, in accordance with the Charlton and
   Danford suggestion that the peripheral criteria might precede the core

   paragraph 3 (conceptual model) and 4 (GASA instrument) in the

   consequences core items into social and emotional consequences.
   Interestingly, our findings suggest that over consumption of video
   games is more heavily associated with negative consequences for male
   gamers but also that their negative consequences of over consumption
   tend to be social rather than emotional, as was the case for female
   gamers. ADHD was significantly associated with over consumption of
   video games and the negative consequences thereof for girls. The male
   participants over consumed games to a higher degree than the females
   and showed more severe consequences, regardless of a potential ADHD
   diagnosis.

   factor for disordered gaming (30, 40) but whether the time spent
   constitute a greater risk for boys than for girls remains unclear. Our
   findings suggest that the association between over consumption of games
   and negative consequences thereof is stronger for boys. Further, our
   results suggest that the negative consequences of over consumption take

   distinction that warrant additional investigation. Bonnaire et al.
   investigated gender differences in disordered gaming and showed that
   male gamers were disproportionately more likely to be single than
   female gamers whereas the female gamers showed a higher anxiety score
   (31). Possibly, the results presented by Bonnaire et al. (31) supports
   the tendency shown in this study using the three-factor structure of

   risk factor for disordered gaming (32, 33, 43–46). In the current CAP
   sample, ADHD was significantly associated with over consumption of
   video games and the negative consequences thereof for girls, an
   association that was not seen among the male participants. Possibly,
   our results could be interpreted as being diagnosed with ADHD increases
   the risk of over consumption of computer games and the negative
   consequences thereof more for girls than for boys. To our knowledge,
   this gender discrepancy has not previously been explored. However,
