Beyond Wordle: the best word games to try next

   Whether you are frustrated by the smash hit puzzle, or hungry for more,

   changed? Or are people just losing interest? Since Wordle caught the
   world's attention, there has been a fast-flowing stream of copycats and
   humorous takes on the word-guessing game, based on everything from
   swearing (Sweardle) to choral music (Byrdle) to geography (Worldle). If

   be pushed aside if you create the sentence ROCK IS MOVE; if there's a

Kitty Letter

   In this gently bizarre, free game, you unscramble words from a
   hexagonal grid of letters to send little armies of exploding cats
   towards your opponent's house. It's quite frantic, rather than

Typeshift

   This is not unlike Wordle - there's a word that the game wants you to
   guess, and you have to puzzle it out - but this gives you a slot
   machine wheel of different letters, and you spin each column around

   and appealing enough to draw kids into some spelling-related fun.
