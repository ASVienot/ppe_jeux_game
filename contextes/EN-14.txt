     It is a basic paradox of games that while the rules themselves are
     generally definite, unambiguous, and easy to use, the enjoyment of a
     game depends on these easy to use rules presenting challenges that
     cannot be easily overcome.
--

   Games are structured activities that are governed by a set of rules.
   The rules of a game define how the game is played, what actions are
   allowed or prohibited, and how players should behave. They provide a
   framework for the game and help to ensure that it is fair and enjoyable
   for all players.

   Rules are an integral part of games, and they serve a variety of
   purposes. One of the main purposes of rules is to establish a level
   playing field for all players. By defining the parameters of the game,
   rules help to ensure that everyone is playing by the same set of rules
   and that no one has an unfair advantage. Rules can also help to make
   games more predictable and strategic, as players can plan their moves
   based on a clear understanding of what is and is not allowed.
--
   Additionally, rules can help to create a sense of structure and order
   in games, which can make them more enjoyable and satisfying to play.
   Finally, rules can help to promote sportsmanship and good behavior in
   games, as they define how players should interact with each other and
   how they should behave.

   In one sense, rules in games are completely arbitrary, because they can
   be anything we make up. But in another sense, they are not arbitrary,
   in the sense that they are not chosen randomly or without purpose, and
   we must obey them in order to play the game properly. Rather, the rules
   of a game are typically carefully designed to create a specific type of
   gameplay experience and to achieve specific goals or objectives.

   For example, the rules of a board game might be designed to create a
   balance between strategy and luck, to make the game challenging but
   also fair for all players. The rules of a video game might be designed
   to create a sense of immersion and to make the game more realistic or
   believable.

   In some cases, the rules of a game may be modified or altered in order
   to achieve a specific goal or to make the game more enjoyable. However,
   even in these cases, the changes to the rules are generally not
--
   Creating a set of rules requires you to mentally switch back and forth
   between the game’s rule framework and the experience that will be
   provided to the followers, er, I mean players, of your rule set. When
   creating rules and games, you’ll frequently think in diagrammatic
   languages, whereas what the players experience is not your wireframes
--

   Constitutive Rules are what count as legal and fair in the game. Any
   attempt to circumvent these restrictions is dishonest.
--
   A Rule of Infraction, like an offsides call or a foul ball, are an
   integral aspect of the game. Strategic infractions include the
   intentional fouling of an opponent for tactical or time-buying purposes
   (like with personal fouls in basketball). Games, however, wouldn’t
   normally permit players to cheat or otherwise violate the laws of the
   game.

   The Rules of Skill are recommendations rather than mandates about how
   to play the game. For instance, it’s illogical to allow players to
   score against themselves (perform own-goals), but it is often possible
--

   A game mechanic is a specific rule or set of rules that defines how a
   game functions and how players interact with it. Game mechanics are an
   essential part of game design and can have a major impact on the
   gameplay experience.

   There are many different types of game mechanics, and they can vary
   widely depending on the type of game. Some common examples of game
   mechanics include:
--
   Resource management: This involves managing and using resources, such
   as money or resources in a game, in order to achieve a goal.

   Chance: This involves using elements of chance, such as dice rolls or
   shuffled decks of cards, to determine the outcome of events in a game.

--
   Role-playing: This involves assuming the role of a specific character
   or persona and acting out that role within the context of the game.

   Whereas computer game systems can readily hide their mechanisms which
   have to be uncovered through interaction, board games nearly always
   have their mechanics laid bare for the player in the rulebook.
   Everything that occurs between the first few turns and someone winning
   the game is categorizable as a game mechanic.

   The game’s mechanics can alter the game state, the options available to
   players, and even other game mechanics. The mechanics of a game can
   either be predetermined by the system or determined by the players
   themselves. If a mechanic leaves no room for player agency, then that
   mechanic is system-driven, which is more common in video games than in
   board games, since the latter tend to put the onus of all
   decision-making on the players themselves.

   The mechanics of video games are frequently easy to figure out by
   observation and experimentation; in many cases, you don’t even need to
   read the manual before getting started. This is where mobile games can
   be particularly engaging: the small screen gives the player only a
   limited amount of room to move their thumb and eyes over the screen.
   Rules aren’t always necessary in mobile games because players have so
   few options on how to interact with the game.

   We should probably define game mechanics more formally now:

     Game mechanics are methods invoked by agents for interacting with
     the game world. (“Defining Game Mechanics,” gamestudies.org)

   Actions in a game require mechanics, such as the ability to roll dice,
   leap, battle, push buttons, take turns, etc. Mechanics can also be

   distorted in digital games, for aesthetic and experiential effect;

   phenomena but rather to express something more human and emotional, and
   this practice continues with video games.
