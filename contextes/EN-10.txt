   aren’t mobile at all: they’re sitting on the sofa, lying in bed or
   (caveat: not recommended) perched on the loo. Most of these games will
   run happily on a recent (say, from the last three or four years) iPhone

   One of the oldest mobile games still being actively supported – it was
   first released in 2009 – Words With Friends could be a marvellous tonic
