   For whatever reason, it seems as though big game hunters are far more
   likely than small game hunters to hit the road and spend a few nights
   camping out in the field. That’s too bad, because road trips can be
   extremely productive for small game hunting, especially when you travel
   to areas that receive very little hunting pressure. At various points
