   Unlike big game hunting, where there are typically separate seasons for
   firearms and archery equipment, there are no legal incentives to hunt
   small game with a bow. There are a few exceptions to this rule,
   including an archery-only duck hunt on a coastal refuge in the vicinity
   of Anchorage, Alaska. That alone should make you interested in archery
   equipment.

   Instead, the decision to hunt small game with a bow typically comes
   down to personal aesthetics. Some hunters value a challenge as much or
   more as they value wild meat, and the thrill of hitting, or trying to

   Nothing will meet these all of these challenges as efficiently as a
   fast-shooting compound bow. What's more, by using the same bow for both
   big game and small game hunting, you'll be practicing for big game
   hunting while chasing small game, and vice-versa.

   Traditional vs Compound
   But if you're considering a bow purchase strictly for small game, and
   more particularly for flushed rabbits and game birds, you should
   consider going with a traditional recurve or longbow that will allow
   you to take snapshots at the fast-moving game. A compound bow must be
   held at full draw to aim and fire; this takes time and prevents snap
   shooting. Here are some additional pros and cons to consider when
   purchasing a bow that you'll use for small game hunting.

   For whatever reason, it seems as though big game hunters are far more
   likely than small game hunters to hit the road and spend a few nights
   camping out in the field. That's too bad, because road trips can be
   extremely productive for small game hunting, especially when you travel
   to areas that receive very little hunting pressure. At various points
   in our lives, my brothers and I have done annual road trips for
