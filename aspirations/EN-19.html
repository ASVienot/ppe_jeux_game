<p>From games that keep you on your feet to ones that test your knowledge, these surprisingly fun team building games for adults are sure to be a hit at your office.</p>
<h3>1. Forensic Sketch Artist</h3>
<p>Forensic Sketch Artist is one of the top engaging office team games that tests your team&#8217;s communication and drawing skills. Split your team into two and set the scene by explaining that a robbery has just occurred. Appoint a forensic sketch artist for each team and name the other team members as witnesses to the robbery. Then, out of the sketch artist&#8217;s view, show the rest of the team a face created by a <a href="https://stability.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">random face generator</a>. The witnesses must describe the face to the sketch artist, who must try to recreate the face based on descriptions from the team. The sketch closest to the generated face wins!</p>
<h3>2. Five Clicks Away</h3>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/the-history-of-the-six-degrees-of-separation-study.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Six Degrees of Separation</a>, Five Clicks Away is an online team building game where team members attempt to connect two seemingly unrelated Wikipedia pages in five clicks. To begin playing, select two topics that seem to have nothing in common, such as BTS and the Battle of Mine Creek. Then, ask your team to use Wikipedia internal links from the first page to navigate to the second. Five Clicks Away is a game that both educates your team on obscure topics and hones your team&#8217;s research skills.</p>

<h3>4. Team Building Bingo</h3>
<p>Team Building Bingo is one of the most exciting DIY team building games for learning more about the people you work with. Prior to playing, brainstorm a series of quirky experiences, organize your thoughts on individualized &#8220;bingo boards,&#8221; and distribute the boards to your team. During the game, players ask each other if they have experienced what is written in the spaces. If a player has had the experience, then that person signs the corresponding space on the asker&#8217;s bingo card. Like traditional bingo, the first player who collects enough signatures to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line across the board wins the round</p>

<h3>24. Silent Interview</h3>
<p>Silent Interview is a unique team building game where teams conduct a job interview without using any words. To start, pair up two participants and have one ask the other interview questions. The interviewee must answer questions using only gestures, expressions, and nonverbal communication. Meanwhile, the team tries to guess the &#8220;candidate&#8217;s&#8221; qualifications based on these silent interactions. At the end of the interview, the team will decide if they would hire this candidate or not. This game is a fun and challenging way to improve communication skills and teamwork in a nontraditional setting.</p>
<h3>25. Number of Things in Common</h3>
<p>Number of Things in Common is a twist on the game &#8220;Something in Common.&#8221; In the original game, teammates are looking for traits they all share. In this version of the game, players go one step further and look for qualities that a certain number of them have in common.</p>
<p>For instance, if your group has four members, then you must find the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something all four have in common</li>
<li>Something three out of four have in common</li>
<li>Something two out of four have in common</li>
<li>Something that none of you have in common (for example, no one has the same favorite food)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, share your best finds with the rest of the group.</p>
<p>This version of the game requires slightly more discussion and strategy than Something in Common.</p>
<h3>26. Popular Opinions</h3>
<p>Popular Opinions is a game that encourages teammates to guess how the majority of their coworkers will answer. The game is simple. A leader gives a question, and players must answer not with their own personal preferences but with the answer they believe will be the most popular among their peers.</p>
<p>For example, if the question is &#8220;What is your favorite drink to order at happy hour?&#8221; and you know that your group frequents the Mexican cantina down the street, then you might answer &#8220;margarita.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can play in teams and come to a group consensus.</p>

<h3>29. Line Game</h3>
<p>The Line Game brings teams together by showing colleagues unexpected commonalities. Before initiating the game, create a list of experiences that underscore the commonalities your team members may have, ordering the list from lighthearted to more serious. Then, gather your team and have team members keep track of every experience. At the end of the game, collect your team&#8217;s responses and display the results, showing your team how much they have in common.</p>
<h3>30. Ambassadors</h3>
<p>Ambassadors is a lively game where team members act as ambassadors for foreign countries. After assigning countries to players using a <a href="https://random.country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">random country generator</a>, each ambassador must describe the assigned country without revealing the country&#8217;s name. The winner is the player who guesses the most countries correctly. Ambassadors is a great game for team building because it is educational and requires your team to exercise creative and communication skills.</p>
<h3>31. Work Limericks</h3>
<p>Limericks are a whimsical form of poetry with a distinct rhythm. In Work Limericks, teams use creative muscles to write limericks based on work experiences. After familiarizing your team with <a href="https://www.poetry4kids.com/lessons/how-to-write-a-limerick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guidelines on how to write limericks</a>, give everyone a period of time to compose limericks. Then, have your team vote on which limericks are their favorites. The limerick with the most votes wins. Work Limericks is an excellent game because it lets your team exercise creativity and share creations with others.</p>
<h3>32. Hangman</h3>
<p>A game you&#8217;ve probably played as a child, Hangman, can also be effective for team building. Not only is your team already familiar with the rules, but Hangman also expands your team&#8217;s vocabulary and establishes shared references that can be great future conversation starters. Also, Hangman is exceptional for team building because it unites the team by pushing your coworkers to work together to successfully guess the word.</p>
<h3>33. Alphabet Chain</h3>
<p>Alphabet Chain is a terrific game for teams who wish to increase vocabularies. In this game, your team first settles on a topic. Then, team members must name words that fit in that topic. However, every word proposed needs to begin with the last letter of the previous one. If a team member is unable to think of a suitable word and breaks the chain, then that person must withdraw. The winner of the game is the last person still remaining. Since Alphabet Chain only requires an expansive vocabulary to play, no materials are needed, making it an easy game to start with.</p>
<h3>34. Dance Off</h3>
<p>Dance Off is a fun game that lets your team express themselves through dance. As the name suggests, the objective of Dance Off is for your team to compete and see who the best dancer is. Create a playlist of danceable tunes and clear a space for your team to move freely. Then, have your team make a circle and begin playing music. Each team member gets a few minutes to show off moves in the center of the circle. Everyone votes for the most impressive dancer, and whoever gets the most votes wins. Dance Off lets your team cut loose and stay active, which is great for stress relief.</p>
<h3>35. The Human Knot</h3>
<p>The Human Knot is one of the most popular free team building games. To play, teammates stand in a circle and grab the hands of coworkers across the way. Then, participants must detangle their arms without breaking their grip. This game improves problem-solving and communication skills among groups. The exercise requires no supplies or costs. Best of all, you can do the challenge repeatedly because the knot will be different each time, and new team members may have different approaches.</p>

<h3>36. Two Truths and One Lie</h3>
<p>Two Truths and One Lie is another fun way to learn more about your colleagues. Best of all, this game requires no materials! In this game, a team member presents two true statements and one lie. The other members have to guess which statement is the lie. If any of the team members guess correctly, then that person earns a point. However, if no one guesses correctly, then the person who presented the statements wins a point. The winner is the person with the most points by the end of the game.</p>
